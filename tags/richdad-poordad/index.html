          <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>There is a Need</p>
<p>Does school prepare children for the real world? “Study hard and get good grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits,” my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to provide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest chance for success in life. When T finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, and near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the “Master Plan,” I was hired by a “Big 8” accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career and retirement at an early age.<br>My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hard-working families, of modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious Washington, D...</p>

          <p>The computer programmer was also unimpressed by the game: “I can buy software to teach me this.”<br>The banker, however, was moved. “I studied this in school-the accounting part, that is-but I never knew how to apply it to real life. Now I know. I need to get myself out of the <code>Rat Race.&#39; &quot;
But it was my daughter&#39;s comments that most touched me. &quot;I had fun learning,&quot; she said. &quot;I learned a lot about how money really works and how to invest.&quot;
Then she added: &quot;Now I know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what this game teaches, I&#39;m free to do and study what my heart wants to study. . .rather than study something because businesses are looking for certain job skills. If I learn this, I won&#39;t have to worry about job security and Social Security the way most of my classmates already do.&quot;

          <p>Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, comparing and then choosing for myself.<br>The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had very different points of view about the subject of money.<br>For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The other, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”<br>As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.<br>Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the sam...</p>

          <p>My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get rich, son?”<br>“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t invited because we were `poor kids’.”<br>“They did?” my dad asked incredulously.<br>“Yeah, they did.” I replied in a hurt tone.<br>My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.<br>The year was 1956. I was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers of the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the...</p>

And you saw the construction supervisor, who is working on a road project about 50 miles from here.

I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in taxes.”<br>“How can that be?” I asked. As a 9-year-old boy, that made no sense to me. “Why would someone let the government do that to them?”<br>Rich dad sat there in silence. I guess he wanted me to listen instead of jabber away at the mouth.<br>Finally, I calmed down. I did not like what I had heard. I knew my dad complained constantly about paying so much in taxes, but really did nothing about it.

          <p>“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.<br>“No, it doesn’t. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.”<br>“Even rich people?” Mike asked.<br>“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know ...</p>

          <p>“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.<br>“Not in an educated society with a well-run government. Prices should actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower prices, but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money’s power.”<br>“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “Aren’t you encouraging me to go to business school for my master’s degree?”<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture,” added...</p>

          <p>Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would recommend or what could they do? “How do they get started?” “Is there a good book I would recommend?” “What should they do to prepare their children?” “What is the secret to success?” “How do I make millions?” I am always reminded of this article I was once given. It goes as follows.</p>
<p>THE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN</p>
<p>In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the world’s largest utility; Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger president of the International Match Co., one of the world’s largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall,...</p>

          <p>So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that “assets put money in your pocket.” Nice, simple and usable.</p>
<p>“This is Cash Flow pattern of a liability.”</p>
<p>Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it may be easier to understand my definitions in words.<br>An asset is something that puts money in my pocket.<br>A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.<br>This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It’s not knowing the difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world.<br>Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle. If people are having difficulties financially, there is something that they cannot read, either in numbers or words. Something is misunderstood. The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people who struggle financially...</p>
