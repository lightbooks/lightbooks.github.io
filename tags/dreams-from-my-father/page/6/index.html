          <p>I decided to stop talking about David after that; I could tell that Auma found the memories too painful. But only a few days later, Auma and I came home to find a car waiting for us outside the apartment. The driver, a brown-skinned man with a prominent Adam’s apple, handed Auma a note.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s an invitation from Ruth,” she said. “Mark’s back from America for the summer. She wants to have us over for lunch.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to go?”</p>
<p>Auma shook her head, a look of disgust on her face. “Ruth knows I’ve been here almost six months now. She doesn’t care about me. The only reason she’s invited us is because she’s curious about you. She wants to compare you to Mark.”</p>
<p>“I think maybe I should go,” I said quietly.</p>
<p>Auma looked at the note again, then handed it back to the driver and said something to him in Swahili. “We’ll both go,” she said, and walked into the apartment.</p>
<p>Ruth lived in Westlands, an enclave of expensive homes set off by wide lawns and well-tended hedges, each o...</p>

          <p>If everyone is family, then no one is family.</p>
<p>Was Zeituni right? I’d come to Kenya thinking that I could somehow force my many worlds into a single, harmonious whole. Instead, the divisions seemed only to have become more multiplied, popping up in the midst of even the simplest chores. I thought back to the previous morning, when Auma and I had gone to book our tickets. The travel agency was owned by Asians; most small businesses in Nairobi were owned by Asians. Right away, Auma had tensed up.</p>
<p>“You see how arrogant they are?” she had whispered as we watched a young Indian woman order her black clerks to and fro. “They call themselves Kenyans, but they want nothing to do with us. As soon as they make their money, they send it off to London or Bombay.”</p>
<p>Her attitude had touched a nerve. “How can you blame Asians for sending their money out of the country,” I had asked her, “after what happened in Uganda?” I had gone on to tell her about the close Indian and Pakistani friends I had back in...</p>

          <p>I tossed a stick into the fire. “Attitudes aren’t so different in America,” I told Francis.</p>
<p>“You are probably right,” he said. “But you see, a rich country like America can perhaps afford to be stupid.”</p>
<p>At that moment, two Masai approached the fire. Francis welcomed them, and as they sat down on one of the benches,</p>
<p>he explained that they would provide security during the night. They were quiet, handsome men, their high cheekbones accentuated by the fire, their lean limbs jutting out of their blood-red shukas, their spears stuck into the ground before them, casting long shadows toward the trees. One of them, who said his name was Wilson, spoke Swahili, and he told us that he lived in a boma a few miles to the east. His silent companion began to pan the darkness with the beam of his flashlight, and Auma asked if the camp had ever been attacked by animals. Wilson grinned.</p>
<p>“Nothing serious,” he said. “But if you have to go to the bathroom at night, you should call one of us to go with you....</p>

          <p>“Don’t worry,” she said to Bernard. “Roy just likes to make everything seem so dramatic.”</p>
<p>Jane’s apartment was in a hubbub when we arrived. In the kitchen, the women were cleaning collards and yams, chopping chicken and stirring ugali. In the living room, younger children set the table or served sodas to the adults. And at the center of this rush sat Roy, his legs spread out in front of him, his arms flung along the back of the sofa, nodding with approval. He waved us over and offered us each a hug. Auma, who hadn’t seen Roy since he’d moved to the States, stepped back to get a better look.</p>
<p>“You’ve become so fat!” she said.</p>
<p>“Fat, eh?” Roy laughed. “A man needs a man-sized appetite.” He turned toward the kitchen. “Which reminds me…where’s that other beer?”</p>
<p>No sooner had the words fallen from his mouth than Kezia came up with a beer in hand, smiling happily. “Barry,” she said in English, “this is the eldest son. Head of the family.”</p>

<p>“No, really, I mean it. It’s just good to be here, with you and Auma and everyone. It’s as if we-”</p>
<p>Before I could finish, we heard a bottle crash to the floor behind us. I spun around to see two men at the far side of the</p>
<p>courtyard pushing another, smaller, man down onto the ground. With one hand, the man on the ground appeared to be covering a cut on his head; with his free arm he was trying to shield himself from the swings of a billy club. I took a step forward, but Roy pulled me back.</p>
<p>“Mind your own business, brother,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“They may be police. I tell you, Barack, you don’t know what it’s like to spend a night in a Nairobi jail.”</p>
<p>By now, the man on the ground had curled up into a tight ball, trying to protect himself from the haphazard blows.</p>

          <p>I studied the pictures for some time, until I noticed one last picture on the wall. It was a vintage print, the kind that grace old Coca-Cola ads, of a white woman with thick dark hair and slightly dreamy eyes. I asked what the print was doing there, and Auma turned to Granny, who answered in Luo.</p>
<p>“She says that that is a picture of one of our grandfather’s wives. He told people that he had married her in Burma when he was in the war.”</p>
<p>Roy laughed. “She doesn’t look very Burmese, eh, Barack?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. She looked like my mother.</p>
<p>We sat down in the living room and Granny made us some tea. She explained that things were well, although she had</p>
<p>given away some of the land to relatives, since she and Yusuf could not work it all by themselves. She made up the lost income by selling lunches to the children at the nearby school and bringing goods from Kisumu to the local market whenever she had some spare cash. Her only real problems were with the roof of the house-she pointed to a few ...</p>

          <p>“What about Yusuf?” Auma asked. “Couldn’t he do more?”</p>
<p>Sayid shook his head. “My brother, he talks like a book, but I’m afraid he does not like to lead by example.”</p>
<p>Auma turned to me. “You know, Yusuf was doing really well for a time. He did well in school, didn’t he, Sayid? He</p>
<p>received several good job offers. Then, I don’t know what happened. He just dropped out. Now he just stays here with Granny, doing small chores for her. It’s as if he’s afraid to try to succeed.”</p>
<p>Sayid nodded. “I think perhaps education doesn’t do us much good unless it is mixed with sweat.”</p>
<p>I thought about what Sayid had said as we continued to walk. Perhaps he was right; perhaps the idea of poverty had been imported to this place, a new standard of need and want that was carried like measles, by me, by Auma, by Yusuf’s archaic radio. To say that poverty was just an idea wasn’t to say that it wasn’t real; the people we’d just met couldn’t ignore the fact that some people had indoor toilets or ate meat every day...</p>

          <p>“Your nephew!” the white-haired man said, pointing to himself.</p>
<p>The short one laughed and said, “His hair is white, but he calls you uncle! Ha-ha. You like this English? Come.”</p>
<p>They led us to a wooden table set with an unlabeled bottle of clear liquid and three glasses. The white-haired man held</p>
<p>up the bottle, then carefully poured what looked like a couple of shots into each glass. “This is better than whiskey, Barry,” Billy said as he lifted his glass. “It makes a man very potent.” He threw the drink down his throat, and Roy and I followed suit. I felt my chest explode, raining down shrapnel into my stomach. The glasses were refilled, but Sayid took a pass, so the short man held the extra drink in front of my eyes, his face distorted through the glass.</p>
<p>“More?”</p>
<p>“Not right now,” I said, suppressing a cough. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>“You may perhaps have something for me?” the white-haired man said. “T-shirt maybe? Shoes?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…I left everything back in Alego.”</p>
<p>The short man kept smiling as if he...</p>

          <p>First there was Miwiru. It’s not known who came before. Miwiru sired Sigoma, Sigoma sired Owiny, Owiny sired Kisodhi, Kisodhi sired Ogelo, Ogelo sired Otondi, Otondi sired Obongo, Obongo sired Okoth, and Okoth sired Opiyo. The women who bore them, their names are forgotten, for that was the way of our people.</p>
<p>Okoth lived in Alego. Before that, it is known only that families traveled a great distance, from the direction of what is now Uganda, and that we were like the Masai, migrating in search of water and grazing land for great herds of cattle. In Alego, the people settled and began to grow crops. Other Luo settled by the lake and learned to fish. There were other tribes, who spoke Bantu, already living in Alego when the Luo came, and great wars were fought. Our ancestor Owiny</p>
<p>was known as a great warrior and leader of his people. He helped to defeat the Bantu armies, but the Bantu were allowed to stay on and marry Luo, and taught us many things about farming and the new land.</p>

          <p>The Kikuyu felt these changes the most, for they lived in the highlands around Nairobi, where white settlement was heaviest. But the Luo also felt the white man’s rule. All persons had to register with the colonial administration and hut taxes steadily increased. This pressured more and more men to work as laborers on the big white farms. In our village, more families now wore the white man’s clothes, and more fathers agreed to send their children to mission school. Of course, even those who went to school could not do the things the white man did. Only whites were allowed to buy certain land or run certain businesses. Other enterprises were reserved by law for the Hindus and the Arabs.</p>
<p>Some men began to try to organize against these policies, to petition and hold demonstrations. But their numbers were few, and most people just struggled to live. Those Africans who did not work as laborers stayed in their villages, trying to maintain the old ways. But even in the villages, attitudes ch...</p>
