<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.</p>
<p>Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northa...</p>

By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was broât up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instr...</p>

          <p>When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written byoneTryon,recommendingavegetablediet.Ideterminedtogointoit. My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded him- self and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh occa- sioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryonâs manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books. But I had another advan- tage in it. My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light re- past, which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handf...</p>

<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my brotherâs case, it was likely I might, if I stayâd, soon bring myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist. I determinâd on the point, but my father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that had got a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me to marry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly. So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17, with...</p>

          <p>About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offerâd for Boston. I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were obligâd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We arrivâd safe, how- ever, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my br. Holmes was not yet returnâd, and had not written about me. My unexpected appearance surprizâd the family; all were, however, very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see him at his printing-house. I was better dressâd than ever while in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my pockets linâd with near five pounds ...</p>

          <p>I presented him an inventory of a little printâg-house, amounting by my computation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He likâd it, but askâd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and see that every thing was good of the kind, might not be of some advantage. âThen,â says he, âwhen there, you may make acquaintances, and estab- lish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way.â I agreed that this might be advantageous. âThen,â says he, âget yourself ready to go with Annis;â which was the annual ship, and the only one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia. But it would be some months before Annis sailâd, so I continuâd working with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me, and in daily apprehensions of being callâd upon by Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some years after.</p>

          <p>Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken passage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work in Maryland, had engagâd the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board know- ing us, were considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it was James, since governor) returnâd from Newcastle to Philadel- phia, the father being recallâd by a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and, just before we sailâd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me</p>

          <p>At my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been usâd to in America, where presswork is mixâd with composing. I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered to see, from this and several instances, that the Water-American, as they called me, was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer! We had an ale- house boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen. My</p>

<p>companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six oâclock, and another when he had done his dayâs work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he supp...</p>

<p>sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.</p>
<p>Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I workâd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive; a great sum out of my small earnings! I lovâd him, notwithstanding, for he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improvâd my fortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read considerably.</p>
<p>We sailâd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726. For the incidents of the voyage, I refer you to my journal, where you will find them all minutely related...</p>
