          <p>His private misery and the poker game were cut short by the crackling of the radio in the corner. The Party Chairman was on his way back from visiting the troops at the front line, and soon other senior politicians would be joining him in party headquarters. The work of the long night was about to begin for the Special Branch protection officers. Just time for the inspector’s colleagues to lay a few final bets as to which Ministers they would still be protecting next week, and which would by then have been dumped in the great waste bin of history.</p>
<p>The Right Honourable Francis Ewan Urquhart was not enjoying himself. Ministerial office brought many pleasures, but this was not one of them. He was squashed into the corner of a small and stuffy living room pressed hard up against a hideous 1950s standard lamp, which showed every sign of wanting to topple over. Try as he could, he had been unable to escape the devoted attentions of the posse of matrons who doubled as his constituency workers...</p>

          <p>Preston’s efforts at increasing the circulation by taking the paper down-market had yet to show the promised results, and the smooth and dapper appearance which he effected was spoilt by the beads of perspiration and concern which constantly appeared on his brow and made his heavy rimmed glasses slip down his nose. The carefully manufactured attempt at outward authority had never fully hidden the. insecurity within.</p>
<p>He turned away from the bank of television monitors which had been piled up against one wall of his office to face the member of staff who had been giving him such a hard time.</p>
<p>‘How the hell do you know it’s going wrong?’ he shouted. Mattie Storin did not flinch. At twenty-eight she was the youngest recruit to the paper’s political staff, having only recently replaced one of the senior correspondents who had fallen foul of the accountants for his habit of conducting interviews over extended lunches at the Savoy. Yet Mattie had a confidence about her judgement which belied t...</p>

          <p>North of the river, a taxi was stuck in a traffic jam on the outskirts of Soho. It was always a bottleneck, and election night seemed to have brought an additional throng of revellers onto the streets. In the back of the taxi Roger O’Neill drummed his fingers impatiently, watching helplessly as the bikes and pedestrians flashed past. He did not have much time.</p>
<p>‘Get over here quick, Rog’ they had said. ‘We can’t wait all bleedin’ night, not even for you. And we ain’t back till Tuesday.’</p>
<p>He neither expected nor received preferential treatment, even as the Party’s Director of Publicity and one of its best-known members of staff. But then he doubted whether they voted at all, let alone for the Government. What did politics matter when there was a lot of loose tax-free money to make?</p>
<p>The taxi at last managed to make it across Shaftesbury</p>
<p>Avenue and into Wardour Street, only to be met by another wall of solid traffic. Christ, he would miss them. He flung open the door.</p>

          <p>Samuel watched unenthusiastically as Urquhart and his wife were forced by the crush of people towards him. ‘Good evening, Francis. Miranda.’ Samuel forced his practised smile. ‘Congratulations. A 17,000 majority. I know about 600 MPs who are going to be very jealous of you in the morning with a majority like that.’</p>
<p>‘Michael! Well, I’m sure you managed to hypnotise the female voters of Surbiton once more. If only you could pick up their husbands’ votes as well, you too could have a majority like mine!’</p>
<p>They laughed gently at the banter, accustomed in public to hiding the fact that they did not enjoy each other’s company, but there was an embarrassed silence as neither of them could think of a suitable means of disengaging rapidly from the conversation.</p>
<p>They were rescued by Williams, who had just put down the phone. ‘Don’t let me interrupt, but Henry will be here any minute.’ I’ll come down with you,’ volunteered Urquhart immediately.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister’s youthful political secretary was waiting at the end of the corridor which led away from the front door towards the Cabinet Room at the rear of the building. As Urquhart approached, he sensed that the young man was uneasy.</p>
<p>The PM is expecting you, Chief Whip’ he said quite unnecessarily. ‘He’s in the study upstairs. I’ll let him know you have arrived,’ and bounded off up the stairs.</p>
<p>It was a full twelve minutes before he reappeared, leaving Urquhart to stare for the hundredth time at the portraits of previous Prime Ministers which adorned the famous staircase. He could never get over the feeling of how inconsequential so many of the recent holders of the office had been. Uninspiring and unfitted for the task. Times had changed, and for the worse. The likes of Lloyd George and Churchill had been magnificent natural leaders, but one had been promiscuous and the other arrogant and often drunk, and neither would have been tolerated by the modern media in the search for ...</p>

          <p>Without knowing quite why, after work Mattie had decided to drive past Urquhart’s London home, just ten minutes away from the House of Commons. She expected to find it dark and empty but instead she discovered that the lights were burning and there were signs of movement around the house, yet still the telephone rang unanswered.</p>
<p>She knew it was not the done thing in Westminster circles for political correspondents to pursue their quarry back to their homes; indeed, it was a practice which was darkly frowned upon not only by politicians but also by other correspondents.

<p>He took a deep mouthful of whisky. ‘If I were the captain of the Titanic and I saw a bloody great iceberg dead ahead, I don’t think I would be saying “steady as she goes”. I’d want a change of course.’</p>
<p>Did you tell this to the Prime Minister this afternoon?’</p>
<p>‘Mattie, you take me too far!’ he chuckled in protest. ‘While I respect your professional integrity and I am thoroughly enjoying our conversation, I think I would be offering you too much temptation if I started divulging the details of private discussions. That’s a shooting offence!’</p>
<p>Mattie had not moved from the edge of her chair. She understood very clearly the significance of his words, and was determined to gather more. ‘Well, let me ask you about Lord Williams.
