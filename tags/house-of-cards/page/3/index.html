          <p>Urquhart went over to his wardrobe and from the back pulled out another Ministerial red box. Like all such boxes, this one was secured with a precision-made, high-security tungsten lock for which he alone had the keys. Inside, nestling in another protective wrapping of polystyrene, sat a modified FM portable radio with inbuilt cassette recorder which was tuned to the wavelength of the transmitter. Urquhart noticed with satisfaction that the long-playing tape he had installed was all but exhausted. He had left the radio transmitter in Woolton’s room pointing towards the bed.</p>
<p>‘I hope it’s not simply because he snores,’ Urquhart joked with himself. As he did so, the equipment clicked once more into action, ran for ten seconds, and stopped.</p>
<p>He pressed the rewind button and was watching the twin reels spin round when the telephone rang, summoning him to the Prime Minister for yet another ‘plumbing lesson’, as he called it.</p>
<p>‘Never mind, you’ll wait,’ he whispered, and relocked both boxes bef...</p>

          <p>There was a short pause for the words to sink in. ‘You cannot afford to get this one wrong.’</p>
<p>Collingridge’s wearied assent was mumbled down the phone. His Chief Whip’s sudden authoritativeness had stripped away piece by piece both his family pride and the dignity of his office. He had neither the will nor the capacity to argue. He looked through the leaded windows across the fields surrounding Chequers to an ancient beech wood. He tried to draw strength and confidence from the magnificent trees glowing golden in the evening sunshine of autumn. They had always been an inspiration to him, a constant reminder that all problems eventually pass, yet this evening, no matter how he tried, they left him feeling empty and hollow.</p>
<p>‘What else do I do?’</p>
<p>‘Nothing. Let us see precisely what the Observer says, then we shall have a better idea. In the meantime, instruct your press office to say nothing while we sort out your brother.’</p>

          <p>He had no specific reason to distrust Williams, of course, but the constant media discussion of a growing gulf between the two began to make a reality of what previously had been only irresponsible and inventive gossip. Distrust is a matter of mind, not fact, and the press had created strong and virulent perceptions. In the circumstances the ageing and proud Party Chairman felt he couldn’t offer advice without being asked, while Collingridge took his silence as probable evidence of disloyalty. Anyway, rationalised Collingridge, party headquarters had let him down badly if not deliberately, and who was responsible for that?</p>
<p>Sarah went for the first visit to Charles, and came back late and very depressed. They were in bed before she could bring herself to talk about it. ‘He looks awful, Henry. I never realised quite how ill he was making himself, but it all seems to have caught up with him in a few days. The doctors are still trying to detoxify him, get all the alcohol out of his system....</p>

<p>A little uncertain as to what he should do, the assistant turned and extracted the envelopes from a numbered pigeon hole behind him. There were three of them. He placed the red envelope on the counter in front of the reporter, with the other two envelopes to one side. He was trying to confirm that the name on the envelope, c/o Charles Collingridge, matched that of the reporter’s identitycards while the camera zoomed in closely on the other two envelopes. It took a few seconds for the operator to focus the concealed equipment properly, but as he did so, the markings on the envelopes came clearly into view. Both were addressed to Charles Collingridge. One bore the imprint of the Union Bank of Turkey. The other had been sent from the Party’s Sales and Literature Office at Smith Square.</p>
<p>The presenter turned once more to confront Collingridge - and there was no doubt left in Collingridge’s mind that the triumphant interview h...</p>

As we have discussed before, I have been keeping him very isolated and away from the newspapers so that he wasn’t disturbed by all the allegations. But we have a problem. Normally we switch his television off and find something to divert him during news programmes, but we weren’t expecting the unscheduled programme about your resignation - I’m deeply sorry you’ve had to resign, by the way, but it’s about Charles I am</p>

Not only does he have an excellent memory for faces, he is also an alcoholic who dried out a couple of years ago. He still goes religiously every week to Alcoholics Anonymous, and he might well be able to put us on the right track.
