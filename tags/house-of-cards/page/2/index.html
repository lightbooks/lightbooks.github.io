          <p>￼The Prime Minister rose ponderously to his feet and glanced at the red briefing folder already open on the Despatch Box in front of him. He read in a monotone.</p>
<p>‘I refer the Honourable Member to the reply I gave some moments ago to Questions One, Two and Four’ Since his earlier reply had said no more than that he would spend the day holding meetings with ministerial colleagues and hosting a dinner for the visiting Belgian Prime Minister, no one had yet learned anything of interest about the Prime Minister’s activities - which was precisely his intention.</p>
<p>Collingridge resumed his seat, and the Speaker summoned Kendrick once more to place his supplementary question. The gladiatorial courtesies were now over, and battle was about to commence. Kendrick rose to his feet from the rear row of the Opposition benches.</p>
<p>Kendrick was a gambler, a man who had found professional success in an industry which emphasised ostentatious reward, yet who had decided to risk his expense account and sports ca...</p>

          <p>Urquhart remained silent, forcing Collingridge to finish off the logic himself. ‘Well, the two Treasury Ministers were scarcely likely to leak the fact that they had screwed it up. But Health bitterly opposed it, so Peter McKenzie had a reason to leak it. Harold Earle at Education has always had a loose</p>
<p>￼lip. And Michael Samuel has a habit of enjoying the company of the media rather too much for my liking.’</p>
<p>The shadowy suspicions which lurk in a Prime Minister’s mind were being brought into the light, and Urquhart relished the spectacle as he watched the seed of accusation grow alongside Collingridge’s insecurity.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities, but I think them unlikely,’ Urquhart joined in. ‘As you know Michael is very close to Teddy Williams. They discuss everything together. It could have come out of party headquarters. Not from Teddy, I mean, but one of the officials there. They can be as tight-lipped as drunken Glaswegians on a Friday night.’</p>
<p>Collingridge pondered this possibility...</p>

          <p>If the PM had trouble in controlling his Cabinet before this, his task now is going to be - what, a nightmare? Impossible?’</p>
<p>‘It is not unusual for Prime Ministers to change their minds. But to be forced to change your mind publicly, simply because you are unable to defend your own decision, is…’</p>
<p>Mattie waited in vain for Urquhart to finish, but realised he would not do so. He would not condemn his Prime Minister, not openly on the stairs, but it was clear there would be no justification either. She prompted the Chief Whip yet again. Isn’t the Government getting accident prone - the second major leak in a matter of weeks? Where are these leaks coming from?’</p>
<p>‘As Chief Whip I am responsible only for discipline on the Government backbenches. You can scarcely expect me to play headmaster to my own Cabinet colleagues as well.’</p>
<p>‘But if it’s coming from Cabinet - who, and why?’</p>
<p>‘I simply don’t know, Mattie. But doubtless the Prime Minister will instruct me to find out who and why.’</p>

          <p>The following morning and less than one week after Firdaus Jhabwala had met with Urquhart, the Chief Whip delivered £50,000 in cash to the party treasurers. Substantial payments in cash were not unique, and the treasurers expressed delight at discovering a new source of funds. Urquhart suggested that the treasurers office make the usual arrangements to ensure that the donor and his wife were invited to a charity reception or two at Downing Street, and asked to lie informed when this happened so that he could make a specific arrangement with the Prime Minister’s political secretary to ensure that Mr and Mrs Jhabwala had ten minutes alone with the Prime Minister beforehand. One of the party treasurers made a careful note of the donor’s address, said that he would write an immediate cryptic letter of thanks, and locked the money in a safe.</p>
<p>Probably uniquely amongst Cabinet Ministers, Urquhart left for holiday that night feeling utterly relaxed.</p>

<p>‘Splendid, Roger. You’ve been most helpful. I hope the Foreign Secretary will be grateful too.’</p>
<p>‘But I still don’t see how you are going to get him to invite Penny to dinner. What’s the point of all this?’</p>
<p>The point, dear Roger, is that he will not have to invite her to dinner at all. He is coming to my reception this evening. You will bring Penny, who you have established is more than willing to meet and spend some time with him. I shall introduce them over a glass of champagne or two, and see what develops. If I know Patrick Woolton - which as Chief Whip I do - it won’t take more than twenty minutes before he’s suggesting that they go to his room to discuss -how does Private Eye put it - Ugandan affairs?’</p>

Perceptions are crucial, Francis, and we shall need a little time to get them right.’</p>
<p>And you need a little time to prepare your own pitch for the job, thought Urquhart. You old fraud. You want the job just as badly as ever.</p>
<p>He knew Woolton would need the time to spend as many evenings as possible in the corridors and bars of the House of Commons strengthening relationships with...</p>

I’ve invested millions in the country. And if you lot don’t pull your fingers out, the whole bloody performance is going down the drain at the next election.

<p>She nodded in gratitude, and the couple squeezed their way through the crowd. No one seemed to notice as they eased their way out of the room, except Urquhart. His cold blue eyes followed them through the door where Landless and O’Neill had gone before. This was certainly going to be a party to remember, he told himself.</p>
