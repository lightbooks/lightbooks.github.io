<p>Earle was confident it would be well received. The speech would glow with rapture about the new horizons and job opportunities which would open up for young people, and the mortal blow he was delivering to the British businessman’s traditionally apathetic approach to dealing with f...</p>

Suddenly, Urquhart stood bolt upright, not twenty yards in front of the deer which froze in confusion.

<p>Urquhart spent all morning walking through the woodlands and across the downs, not returning home until almost noon. When he did so, he walked straight into his study without changing, and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>He first called the editors of the four leading Sunday newspapers. He discovered that two of them were writing editorials supporting him, one was supporting Samuel and the other was noncommittal.
