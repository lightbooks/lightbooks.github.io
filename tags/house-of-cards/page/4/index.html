<p>Yet the story kept taking over and pushing to one side</p>
<p>any thoughts of dismay in her mind, while the Telegraph’s editorial intervention had given it a totally new twist.

Roger and I went to Paddington in a taxi, and he sent me in to do the paper work. I knew he felt uneasy at the time, I think he sensed there was something wrong. And when he realised what it had been used for and how much trouble it had caused, he just began going to pieces.’</p>
<p>‘Why did Mr Collingridge ask Roger to open the address and not do it himself ?’</p>
<p>I’ve no idea, really. Perhaps he felt guilty because of what he was going to use it for. Roger just breezed into the office one day during the summer and said he’d got a favour to do for Charles Collingridge, that it was terribly confidential and I was to breathe a word to no one.’</p>

<p>If I know our Ben, he won’t be relying just on industrial logic or compelling rhetoric. He will have prepared the ground very carefully beforehand. We’ll soon see how many politicians owe him favours.’</p>
<p>The answer seemed to be that many politicians owed Landless, at least on the Government side. With nominations closing the following day and the first ballot due in just a week, few contenders seemed willing to risk antagonising the combined might of the Telegraph and United groups and their substantial number of national newspapers. Within hours the endorsements for Landless grew into a stampede of support amongst contenders as they struggled not to be left behind in finding airtime to praise his ‘enlightened and patriotic industrial leadership’. By teatime, Landless was well pleased with his day’s work and the careful planning which had gone into it. Once again, it seemed that his sense of riming and understanding of politicians had been j...</p>

A brightly decked hall packed with supporters whom he could greet on first-name terms - in front of the cameras, of course - seemed an ideal location for a major pronouncement on schools ‘ policy. He and his officials had been working on it for some time, and with just a little hurrying forward they would have it ready for announcement on Saturday - a Government-sponsored plan offering school leavers who could not find a job not only a guaranteed place on a training course, but now the opportunity to complete that training in another Common Market country, providing practical skills and language training as well.</p>

I would remind everyone that those wishing to offer themselves as candidates for the second ballot must resubmit their nominations to me by Thursday. I declare this meeting closed!’</p>
<p>Urquhart was giving some celebratory drinks to colleagues in his room. It was one of the finest offices available to a Member, located on the premises rather than in one of the various annexes spotted around the periphery of the Palace of Westminster, large and airy with a gracious bow window offering a fine view across the river to the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ancient Gothic home at Lambeth Palace. The room was now crowded with several dozen Members, a...</p>
