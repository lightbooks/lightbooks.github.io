<p>ribs.</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to be concerned about health, remember?”</p>
<p>“It’s too late for me, girl,” Shirley muttered, but the pack went back into her purse. A group of men in suits and ties</p>
<p>came out of the door behind the receptionist’s desk and gave our contingent the once-over as they walked to the elevator. Linda whispered something to Bernadette; Bernadette whispered back.</p>
<p>“What’s everybody whispering for?” I asked loudly.</p>
<p>The children giggled. Bernadette said, “I feel like I’m waiting to see the principal or something.”</p>
<p>“You hear that, everybody,” I said. “They build these big offices to make you feel intimidated. Just remember that this</p>
<p>is a public authority. Folks who work here are responsible to you.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” the receptionist said to us, her voice rising to match mine. “I’ve been told that the director will not be</p>

          <p>‘Don’t worry, Pen. I’ll deal with it.’ He fell back on the swaggering confidence of years of salesmanship, of persuading people to buy ideas and arguments, not because they were all particularly good but because his audiences found themselves captivated by his energy and enthusiasm. In a world full of cynicism, they wanted to put their trust in a man who seemed to believe so passionately in what he was offering.</p>
<p>When Mattie arrived in his office after lunch, he was bright, alert, those strange eyes of his still amazingly animated but seeming very anxious to help.</p>
<p>‘Just a stomach upset’ he explained. ‘Sorry I had to stand you up.’</p>
<p>Mattie acknowledged that his smile was full of charm; it was difficult not to want to believe him. ‘I understand you were asking about Mr Collingridge’s accommodation address?’</p>
<p>￼’Sounds as if you are admitting that it was Charles Collingridge’s address?’ she enquired.</p>

          <p>Inside, only a few of the parents remained. Linda stood alone in one corner, sobbing. I came up and put my arm around her shoulder.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m so embarrassed,” she said, gulping down a sob. “I don’t know what happened, Barack. With all the people…seems like I just always mess things up.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t mess up,” I said. “If anybody messed up, it was me.” I called the others together into a circle and tried to offer encouragement. The turnout was great, I said, which meant people were willing to get involved. Most of the residents would still support our effort. We would learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>“And the director sure knows who we are now,” Shirley said.</p>
<p>This last line drew some weak laughter. Sadie said she had to get home; I told the group that I could take care of cleaning up. As I watched Bernadette pick up Tyrone in one arm and carry his slumbering weight across the gymnasium floor, I felt my stomach constrict. Dr. Collier tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>There was general commotion as the tension ebbed, congratulations and condolences were exchanged, and one Member leaned around the door to give the highlights to the anxious press.</p>
<p>‘Accordingly’ Sir Humphrey continued, ‘no candidate has been elected and there-will be a second round of balloting a week today. I would remind everyone that those wishing to offer themselves as candidates for the second ballot must resubmit their nominations to me by Thursday. I declare this meeting closed!’</p>
<p>Urquhart was giving some celebratory drinks to colleagues in his room. It was one of the finest offices available to a Member, located on the premises rather than in one of the various annexes spotted around the periphery of the Palace of Westminster, large and airy with a gracious bow window offering a fine view across the river to the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ancient Gothic home at Lambeth Palace.

          <p>“So that’s what we’re dealing with here. Where I can, I try to fill the void. I expose students to African history, geography, artistic traditions. I try to give them a different values orientation-something to counteract the materialism and individualism and instant gratification that’s fed to them the other fifteen hours of their day. I teach them that Africans are a communal people. That Africans respect their elders. Some of my European colleagues feel threatened by this, but I tell them it’s not about denigrating other cultures. It’s about giving these young people a base for themselves. Unless they’re rooted in their own traditions, they won’t ever be able to appreciate what other cultures have to offer-”</p>

As soon as the cameramen were ready, he began.</p>
<p>‘Good afternoon. I’ve got a short statement to make, and I’m sorry that I will not have time afterwards for questions. But I hope you will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>‘Following the ballot on Tuesday, it seems as if only three candidates have any realistic chance of success. Indeed, I und...</p>

Seems she’s kinda bored around the house, see, and Dr. King thinks she’d make an ‘excellent’ director for our program. No pressure, you understand.

<p>“Naw-”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, Barack, he had the whole thing figured out. And you know what? The whole time we’re talking, he’s not batting an eye. Acting like what he’s doing is the most natural thing in the world. It was unbelievable.” Johnnie shook his head, then suddenly shouted out like a preacher. “Yessuh! Doctah Lonnie King! Now there’s a brother with some nerve! An enterprising brother! Program hasn’t even started yet, he’s already thinking ahead....</p>

<p>Urquhart spent all morning walking through the woodlands and across the downs, not returning home until almost noon. When he did so, he walked straight into his study without changing, and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>He first called the editors of the four leading Sunday newspapers. He discovered that two of them were writing editorials supporting him, one was supporting Samuel and the other was noncommittal. However, all four were confident in varying degrees that he had a clear advantage, a conclusion confirmed by the Obs...</p>
