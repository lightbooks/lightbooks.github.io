          <p>The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase “the rat race.” They treat their home as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets.</p>
<p>Why the Middle Class Struggle</p>
<p>Income goes up, Expenses go up<br>Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase</p>
<p>This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. This process of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a regular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education.<br>The massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has brought to l...</p>

          <p>There is a big difference between your profession and your business. Often I ask people, “What is your business?” And they will say, “Oh I’m a banker.” Then I ask them if they own the bank? And they usually respond.  “No, I work there.”<br>In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may be a banker, but they still need their own business.  Ray Kroc was clear on the difference between his profession and his business. His profession was always the same.  Me was a salesman. At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling hamburger franchises- But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business was the accumulation of income-producing real estate.<br>A problem with school is that you often become what you study.  So if you study, say, cooking, you become a chef.  If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is ...</p>

          <p>I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.<br>Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” Or “The rich should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.”<br>It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The real reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class who pays for the poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class.<br>Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the historical perspective. We need to look at the history of taxes. Although my highly edu...</p>

          <p>You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a little boy of 9 who had to sit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. I often sat in his office waiting for him to “get to me.” He was ignoring me on purpose.  He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world pushes you around.  Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man will always take more if you let him.<br>The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power.<br>Once we had this knowledge of th...</p>

          <p>The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell ended. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a local company. The workers were angry and complained that the company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see.

So as a student, I made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil tankers and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich dad emphasized that I stay in the Pacific instead of taking ships to Europe because he knew that the “emerging nations” were in Asia, not Europe. While most of my classmates, including Mike, were partying at their fraternity houses, I was studying trade, people, business styles and cultures in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Korea, Tahiti, Samoa and the Philippines. I also was partying, but it was not in any frat house. I grew up rapidly.<br>Educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and join the Marine Corps.

          <p>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him that she had left him $35,000. That is what was left of her estate after the attorney and the government took their shares.  Immediately, he saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this money to advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine that targeted the very rich. The ad ran for three months.  He received no replies from the ad, and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for misrepresentation.<br>This is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned, his only reply was that “advertising salespeople are crooks.” I then asked him if he would be willing to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the time, and I don’t want to waste my mo...</p>

          <p>He constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack of financial success was because most people played it too safe.  “People are so afraid of losing that they lose” were his words.<br>Fran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still another way: “Winning means being unafraid to lose.”<br>In my own life, I’ve noticed that winning usually follows losing. Before I finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times. I’ve never met a golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I’ve never met people who have fallen in love who have never had their heart broken. And I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money.<br>So for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.   Another saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to Heaven, but no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are terrified of losing money.  So they never get to Heaven.<br>Rich dad used to tell Mike and m...</p>

          <p>Richard’s backing out did not surprise me.  It’s called “buyer’s remorse,” and it affects all of us. It’s those doubts that get us. The little 1 chicken won, and a chance at freedom was lost.<br>In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in tax lien certificates instead of CDs. I earn 16 percent per year on my money, which certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers. The certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than most banks. The formula they’re bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look at them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they have money in CDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it’s risky. They tell me why I should not do it. When I ask them where they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment magazine. They’ve never done it, and they’re telling someone who’s doing it why they shouldn’t. The lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent...</p>

          <p>So how do you beat laziness? The answer is a little greed.  It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In It-For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What’s in it for me if I’m healthy, sexy and good looking?”  Or “What would my life be like if I never had to work again?” Or “What would I do if I had all the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a better life.  New inventions are made because we desire something better. We go to school and study hard because we want something better.  So whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is “What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.<br>Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. But just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street. “Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: “Guil...</p>
