<p>I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv’d at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavor an accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that his majesty’s service might not be obstructed by their dissensions.

<p>He leaned towards Urquhart. ‘I suspect you have no great love for Teddy Williams, particularly after he did such an effective demolition job on your reshuffle proposals - I’m sure you guessed that at the time’</p>
<p>Urquhart was glad to have his suspicions confirmed. On Judgement Day it might help to justify a lot of his recent actions.</p>
<p>‘So what can I do, Francis, to make sure this election is run properly?’</p>
<p>Urquhart smiled to himself. A ‘proper’ election ...</p>

          <p>This is a story of how I fell in love with a woman, who read me a specific story from Herodotus. I heard the words she spoke across the fire, never looking up, even when she teased her husband. Perhaps she was just reading it to him. Perhaps there was no ulterior motive in the selection except for them¬selves. It was simply a story that had jarred her in its familiar¬ity of situation. But a path suddenly revealed itself in real life. Even though she had not conceived it as a first errant step in any way. I am sure.</p>
<p>“I will place you in the room where we sleep, behind the open door; and after I have gone in, my wife will also come to lie down. Now there is a seat near the entrance of the room and on this she lays her garments as she takes them off one by one; and so you will be able to gaze at her at full leisure.”</p>

And I? I was the skill among them. The mechanic. The others wrote out their love of solitude and meditated on what they found there. They were never sure of what I thought of it all. “Do you like that moon?” Madox asked me after he’d known me for ten years. He asked it tentatively, as if he had breached an intimacy. For the...</p>

          <p>I’d always taken such markets for granted, part of the natural order of things. Now, though, as I thought about Altgeld and Rose-land, Rafiq and Mr. Foster, I saw those Djakarta markets for what they were: fragile, precious things. The people who sold their goods there might have been poor, poorer even than folks out in Altgeld. They hauled fifty pounds of firewood on their backs every day, they ate little, they died young. And yet for all that poverty, there remained in their lives a discernible order, a tapestry of trading routes and middlemen, bribes to pay and customs to observe, the habits of a generation played out every day beneath the bargaining and the noise and the swirling dust.</p>
<p>It was the absence of such coherence that made a place like Altgeld so desperate, I thought to myself; it was that loss of order that had made both Rafiq and Mr. Foster, in their own ways, so bitter. For how could we go about stitching a culture back together once it was torn? How long might it take ...</p>

She parked her car on the road and walked cautiously up the drive towards the door.</p>
<p>A large, tweed-suited gentleman with a white military moustache approached and her heart sank. This was surely the security patrol, and she had clearly been spotted as an intruder.</p>
<p>‘Excuse me, my dear,’ he said in a clipped accent as he intercepted her by the front door. ‘Have you seen any member of staff about? They like to keep out of the way on family visiting days, but you can never find one when you want them.’</p>
