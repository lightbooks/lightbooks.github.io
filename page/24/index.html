His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had already left before you got here.”<br>“Does this go on all the time?” I asked.<br>“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair to sit down next to me.<br>“I asked him if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said.<br>“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity.<br>“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he would make us an offer.”<br>“Oh,” I said, rocking my chair back against the wall; I sat there<br>perched on two rear legs of the chair.<br>Mike did the same thing.<br>“Do you know what the offer is?” I asked.<br>“No, but we’ll soon find out.”<br>Suddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the porch.

          <p>“Why do people let the government do that to them?”<br>“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the middle class do. I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in taxes.”<br>“How can that be?” I asked. As a 9-year-old boy, that made no sense to me. “Why would someone let the government do that to them?”<br>Rich dad sat there in silence. I guess he wanted me to listen instead of jabber away at the mouth.<br>Finally, I calmed down. I did not like what I had heard. I knew my dad complained constantly about paying so much in taxes, but really did nothing about it. Was that life pushing him around?<br>Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me.<br>“Ready to learn?” he asked.<br>I nodded my head slowly.<br>“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends.

          <p>“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.<br>“No, it doesn’t. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.”<br>“Even rich people?” Mike asked.<br>“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know ...</p>

Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower prices, but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money’s power.”<br>“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “Aren’t you encouraging me to go to business school for my master’s degree?”<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture,” added...</p>

<p>THE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN</p>
<p>In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the world’s largest utility; Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger president of the International Match Co., one of the world’s largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall,...</p>

          <p>So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that “assets put money in your pocket.” Nice, simple and usable.</p>
<p>“This is Cash Flow pattern of a liability.”</p>
<p>Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it may be easier to understand my definitions in words.<br>An asset is something that puts money in my pocket.<br>A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.<br>This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It’s not knowing the difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world.<br>Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle. If people are having difficulties financially, there is something that they cannot read, either in numbers or words. Something is misunderstood. The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people who struggle financially...</p>

          <p>The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase “the rat race.” They treat their home as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets.</p>
<p>Why the Middle Class Struggle</p>
<p>Income goes up, Expenses go up<br>Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase</p>
<p>This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. This process of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a regular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education.<br>The massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has brought to l...</p>

And they usually respond.  “No, I work there.”<br>In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may be a banker, but they still need their own business.  Ray Kroc was clear on the difference between his profession and his business. His profession was always the same.  Me was a salesman. At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling hamburger franchises- But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business was the accumulation of income-producing real estate.<br>A problem with school is that you often become what you study.  So if you study, say, cooking, you become a chef.  If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is ...</p>

          <p>I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.<br>Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” Or “The rich should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.”<br>It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The real reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class who pays for the poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class.<br>Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the historical perspective. We need to look at the history of taxes. Although my highly edu...</p>

          <p>You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a little boy of 9 who had to sit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. I often sat in his office waiting for him to “get to me.” He was ignoring me on purpose.  He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world pushes you around.  Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man will always take more if you let him.<br>The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power.<br>Once we had this knowledge of th...</p>
