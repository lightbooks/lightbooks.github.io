<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfac- tion to the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ’d; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately should en- deavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more young citi- zens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the gen- eral sentiments of...</p>

<p>￼￼￼What were we to this young couple? Some of us had written books about dune formation, the disappearance and reappear¬ance of oases, the lost culture of deserts. We seemed to be interested only in things that could not be bought or sold, of no interest to the outside world. We argued about latitudes, or about an event that had happened seven hundred years earlier. The theorems of exploration. That Abd el Melik Ibra-him el Zwaya who lived in Zuck oasis pasturing camels was the first man among those tribes who could understand the concept of photographs.</p>
<p>The Cliftons were on the last days of their honeymoon. I left them with the others and went to join a man in Kufra and spent many days with him, trying out theories I had kept secret from the rest of the expedition. I returned to the base camp at El Jof three nights later.</p>
<p>The desert fire was between us. The Cliftons, Madox, Bell and myself. If a man leaned back a few inches he would dis¬appe...</p>

You want a direct answer? OK. A majority of 24 simply isn’t enough, and at the rate we are going we shall get wiped out next time around. We cannot go on as we are.’</p>
<p>‘So what is the solution? We have to find one.’</p>
<p>‘We wait. We need time, a few months, to prepare the public perception and pressure for the PM to stand down, so that when he does we shall be seen to be responding to a positive public demand rather than indulging in private squabbles. Perceptions are crucial, Francis, and we shall need a little time to get them right.’</p>
<p>And you need a little time to prepare your own pitch for the job, thought Urquhart. You old fraud. You want the job just as badly as ever.</p>

          <p>It was around that time that I got involved in the divestment campaign. It had started as something of a lark, I suppose, part of the radical pose my friends and I sought to maintain, a subconscious end run around issues closer to home. But as the months passed and I found myself drawn into a larger role-contacting representatives of the African National Congress to speak on campus, drafting letters to the faculty, printing up flyers, arguing strategy-I noticed that people had begun to listen to my opinions. It was a discovery that made me hungry for words. Not words to hide behind but words that could carry a message, support an idea. When we started planning the rally for the trustees’ meeting, and somebody suggested that I open the thing, I quickly agreed. I figured I was ready, and could reach people where it counted. I thought my voice wouldn’t fail me.</p>
<p>Let’s see, now. What was it that I had been thinking in those days leading up to the rally? The agenda had been carefully arrange...</p>

          <p>So Regina was right; it had been just about me. My fear. My needs. And now? I imagined Regina’s grandmother somewhere, her back bent, the flesh of her arms shaking as she scrubbed an endless floor. Slowly, the old woman lifted her head to look straight at me, and in her sagging face I saw that what bound us together went beyond anger or despair or pity.</p>
<p>What was she asking of me, then? Determination, mostly. The determination to push against whatever power kept her stooped instead of standing straight. The determination to resist the easy or the expedient. You might be locked into a</p>
<p>world not of your own making, her eyes said, but you still have a claim on how it is shaped. You still have responsibilities.</p>
<p>The old woman’s face dissolved from my mind, only to be replaced by a series of others. The copper-skinned face of the Mexican maid, straining as she carries out the garbage. The face of Lolo’s mother drawn with grief as she watches the Dutch burn down her house. The tight-lipped, ch...</p>

<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>

The sight of their miserable situation inspir’d the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Or- phan House there, in which they might be supported and educated. Re- turning northward, he preach’d up this charity, and made large collec- tions, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.</p>
<p>I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from Phila- delphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to have built the house here, and brought the childr...</p>

          <p>‘But that’s all bloody Horlicks, Frankie, and you know it. I put my whole newspaper chain behind your lot at the last election and I’ve moved my entire worldwide headquarters to London. I’ve invested millions in the country. And if you lot don’t pull your fingers out, the whole bloody performance is going down the drain at the next election. Those buggers in the Opposition will crucify me if they get in because I’ve been so good to you, but you lot</p>

<p>He paused to produce a large silk handkerchief from within the folds of his trousers and wipe his brow, while Urquhart goaded him on. ‘Surely it’s not as bad as that, Ben. All Governments go through sticky patches. We’ve been through this all before - we’ll pull out of it!’</p>
<p>‘Horlicks, Horlicks, bloody Horlicks. That’s complacent crap, and you know it, Frankie. Haven’t you seen your own latest poll? They phoned it through to me earlier this afternoon. You’re down another 3...</p>

          <p>It was well past midnight by the time I crawled through a fence that led to an alleyway. I found a dry spot, propped my luggage beneath me, and fell asleep, the sound of drums softly shaping my dreams. In the morning, I woke up to find a white hen pecking at the garbage near my feet. Across the street, a homeless man was washing himself at an open hydrant and didn’t object when I joined him. There was still no one home at the apartment, but Sadik answered his phone when I called him and told me to catch a cab to his place on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p>He greeted me on the street, a short, well-built Pakistani who had come to New York from London two years earlier and found his caustic wit and unabashed desire to make money perfectly pitched to the city’s mood. He had overstayed his tourist visa and now made a living in New York’s high-turnover, illegal immigrant workforce, waiting on tables. As we entered the apartment I saw a woman in her underwear sitting at the kitchen table, a mirror and...</p>

<p>“Precisely. It’s all a perfect background. Two nights ago, when we were trying to name the dog. Remember?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>￼￼￼“He was strange that night.”</p>
<p>“He was very strange, because I gave him an extra dose of morphine. Do you remember the names? He put out about eight names. Five of them were obvious jokes. Then three names. Cicero. Zerzura. Delilah.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“ ‘Cicero’ was a code name for a spy. The British unearthed him. A double then triple agent. He got away. ‘Zerzura’ is more complicated.”</p>
<p>“I know about Zerzura. He’s talked about it. He also talks about gardens.”</p>
<p>“But it is mostly the desert now. The English garden is wearing thin. He’s dying. I think you have the spy-helper Almasy upstairs.”</p>
<p>They sit on the old cane hampers of the linen room looking at each other. Caravaggio shrugs. “It’s possible.”</p>
