It also killed Mr. Fred Harts and Miss Morden and four sappers Lord Suffolk was training. May 1941. Singh had been with Suffolk’s unit for a year. He was working in London that day with Lieutenant Blackler, clearing the Elephant and Castle area of a Satan bomb. They had worked together at defusing the 4,ooo-pound bomb and were exhausted. He remembered halfway through he looked up and saw a couple of bomb disposal officers pointing in his direction and wondered what that was about. It probably meant they had found another bomb. It was after ten at night and he was dangerously tired. There was another one waiting for him. He turned back to work.</p>

<p>“I tried. His office didn’t write back.”</p>

<p>you’re young and black and interested in social issues? Find a political campaign to work for. A powerful patron- somebody who can help you with your own career. And Harold’s powerful, no doubt about it. Lots of charisma. He has almost monolithic support in the black community. About half the Hispanics, a handful of white liberals. You’re right about one thing, though. The whole atmosphere in the city is polarized. A big media circus. Not much is getting done.”</p>
<p>I leaned back in my seat. “And whose fault is that?”</p>
<p>Marty put his glasses back on and met my stare. “It’s not a question of fault,” he said. “It’s a question of whether any politician, even somebody with Harold’s talent, can do much to break the cycle. A polarized...</p>

          <p>In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of com- missioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv’d this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and my- self to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv’d the nomination, and pro- vided the goods for the present, and tho’ they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.</p>
<p>In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general purposes. As we ...</p>

Distrust is a matter of mind, not fact, and the press had created strong and virulent perceptions. In the circumstances the ageing and proud Party Chairman felt he couldn’t offer advice without being asked, while Collingridge took his silence as probable evidence of disloyalty. Anyway, rationalised Collingridge, party headquarters had let him down badly if not deliberately, and who was responsible for that?</p>

He knew he was for now a king, a puppet master, could order anything, a bucket of sand, a fruit pie for his needs, and those men who would not cross an uncrowded bar to speak with him when they were off duty would do what he desired. It was strange to him. As if he had been handed a large suit of clothes that he could roll around in and whose sleeves would drag behind him. But he knew he did not like it. He was accustomed to his invisibility. In England he was ignored in the various barracks, and he came to prefer that. The self-sufficiency and privacy Hana saw in him later were caused not just by his being a sapper in the Italian campaign. It was as much a result of being the anonymous member of another race, a part of the invisible world. He had built up defences of character against all that, trusting only those who befriended him. But that night in Erith he knew he was capable of havin...</p>

<p>“Hey, that part’s free. Haircut’s ten dollars. What’s your name, anyway?” “Barack.”</p>
<p>“Barack, huh. You a Muslim?”</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, Marty picked me up in front of my new address and we headed south on the Skyway. After several miles, we took an exit leading into the southeast side, past rows of small houses made of gray clapboard or brick, until we arrived at a massive old factory that stretched out over several blocks.</p>

          <p>The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colo- nies as propos’d at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspi- cions and jealousies at this time being entertain’d of them, sent over Gen- eral Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that pur- pose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march’d to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish’d me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the sev- eral provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspon- dence, and of which they propos’d to pay the expense.

          <p>‘That’s an excellent question, Mattie, but I don’t know the answer. It can’t be politics, Landless has never given a damn about that. He has politicians of every party in his pocket. I can only think it’s personal in some way’</p>
<p>If it’s personal it must be business. That’s the only thing which really rattles his cage.’ ‘But I can’t figure out why he should have fallen out with Collingridge over business.’ ‘And I would love to know who he’s got on the inside.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Krajewski.</p>
<p>‘Grev couldn’t have concocted that article without the material on the opinion poll. Without my copy on which to work he had nothing, and without the leaked statistics I had nothing either. And at the same time as this occurs, Landless decides to ditch Collingridge. It’s too much of a coincidence for that all to have come together by chance’. She banged her hand on the table with a renewed passion. ‘But it can’t be Landless on his own. There’s somebody on the inside of the Party leaking polls and...</p>

          <p>VIII The Holy Forest</p>
<p>KIP WALKS OUT of the field where he has been digging, his left hand raised in front of him as if he has sprained it.</p>
<p>He passes the scarecrow for Hana’s garden, the crucifix with its hanging sardine cans, and moves uphill towards the villa. He cups the hand held in front of him with the other as if protecting the flame of a candle. Hana meets him on the terrace, and he takes her hand and holds it against his. The ladybird circling the nail on his small finger quickly crosses over onto her wrist.</p>
<p>She turns back into the house. Now her hand is held out in front of her. She walks through the kitchen and up the stairs.</p>

<p>￼￼￼The patient turns to face her as she comes in. She touches his foot with the hand that holds the ladybird. It leaves her, moving onto the dark skin. Avoiding the sea of white sheet, it begins to make the long trek towards the distance of the rest of his body, a bright redness against what seems like volcanic...</p>

          <p>can do when we put our minds to it. That good feeling you got right now, we got to keep it going till we got this neighborhood back on its feet.”</p>
<p>A few people smiled and offered an amen. But as I stepped off the bus, I heard a woman behind me whispering to her friend, “I don’t need to hear about the neighborhood, girl. Where these jobs they talking about?”</p>
<p>The day after the rally, Marty decided it was time for me to do some real work, and he handed me a long list of people to interview. Find out their self-interest, he said. That’s why people become involved in organizing-because they think they’ll get something out of it. Once I found an issue enough people cared about, I could take them into action. With enough actions, I could start to build power.</p>
<p>Issues, action, power, self-interest. I liked these concepts. They bespoke a certain hardheadedness, a worldly lack of sentiment; politics, not religion. For the next three weeks, I worked day and night, setting up and conducting my inter...</p>
