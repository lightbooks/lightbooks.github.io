          <p>As he gazed out over the Thames towards the South Bank arts complex, Kendrick poured tea and opened his heart. ‘I have to say I never really expected all this,’ he said. ‘But I’ve grown to like it very much indeed.’</p>
<p>You’ve also managed to make your mark very quickly,’ Mattie smiled her most winning of smiles and recrossed her legs. She had been careful to discard her favoured trousers for a fashionable blouse and skirt which showed off her legs and slender ankles to their best effect. She needed some information, and would buy it with a little flirting if needs be.</p>
<p>I’m doing a feature piece on the decline and fall of the Prime Minister, trying to get behind the basic news stories and talk to those who played a part in it, whether they had intended to or not. It won’t be an unsympathetic piece, I’m not trying to moralise or lay blame. I’m trying rather to offer an insight into how Parliament works and how politics can be so full of surprises. And when it comes to surprises, yours was one of the biggest.’</p>
<p>Kendrick chuckled. Tm still amazed at how my parliamentary reputation was built on such a - well, what would you call it? Stroke of luck? Throw of the dice? Guess work?’</p>
<p>‘Are you saying you didn’t actually know that the hospital scheme had been shelved, that you were guessing?’ Put it this way. I wasn’t absolutely certain. I took a risk.’ ‘So what did you know?’</p>
<p>‘Well, Mattie, I’ve never really told the full story before to anyone …’ He glanced down to where Mattie was rubbing her ankles, as if to relieve sore shins. ‘But I suppose there’s no harm in telling you a little of the background.’</p>
<p>He pondered a second to decide how far he should go. ‘I discovered that the Government - or rather their party headquarters - had planned a massive publicity campaign to promote the new plan for expanding hospitals. They had worked hard at it, spent a lot of money on the preparations, yet at the last minute they cancelled the whole thing. Just pulled the plug on it. I thought about this for a long while, and the only explanation I could reach was that they were actually pulling the plug, not just on the publicity campaign but on the policy itself. So I challenged the Prime Minister - and he fell for it! I couldn’t have been more surprised myself.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t remember any discussion at the time about a publicity campaign. It must have been kept very quiet.’ ‘Of course, they wanted to keep the element of surprise. I believe all the planning of it was highly confidential.’ ‘You obviously have excellent confidential sources.’</p>
<p>‘Yes. And they are staying confidential, even from you, I’m afraid!’</p>
<p>Mattie knew that she would need to offer much more than a flashing pair of ankles to get that sort of information out of him, and she was unwilling to pay so high a price.</p>
<p>‘Of course, Stephen. I know how valuable sources are. But can you give me a little guidance? The leak could only have come from one of two sources, Party or Government, yes… ?’</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‘And there has been a tremendous amount of publicity about the rift between party headquarters and Downing Street in recent months. Particularly as it was to be a party publicity drive, it would be logical to suspect that the information came out of party headquarters.’</p>
<p>She raised an enquiring eyebrow, and puckered her lips.</p>
<p>‘You’re very good, very good, Mattie. But you didn’t get that from me, OK? And I’m not saying any more about my source. You’re too hot by half!’</p>
<p>He was beginning to chuckle merrily when Mattie played her own hunch.</p>
<p>‘No need to worry. I want to write a feature piece, not conduct an inquisition. Roger’s secret is safe with me.’</p>
<p>Kendrick spat out the mouthful of tea he was trying to drink and started choking.</p>
<p>‘I never… said anything about… Roger!’ he spluttered. But he knew he had betrayed his familiarity with O’Neill, and the calm face he was trying to restore simply eluded him. He decided to surrender.</p>
<p>‘Jesus. How did you know? Look, Mattie. Big favour time. I didn’t say anything about Roger. We’re old friends and I don’t want to land him in any sort</p>
<p>￼of hot water. He’s got enough at Smith Square as it is, eh?’ Mattie laughed loudly, teasing the politician for his discomfort.</p>
<p>‘Your sordid secret is safe with me,’ she assured him. ‘But when you have risen to become a senior member of Government some time in the future, perhaps even Prime Minister, I hope you will remember you owe me!’</p>
<p>They both laughed loudly at the banter but, inside, Mattie’s stomach churned. Another piece of the jigsaw had just fallen into place.</p>
<p>They were there at lunchtime and still there in the evening, just reading, picking their teeth, and watching. Like avenging angels they had waited for Earle in their sordid little car from over forty-eight hours, witnessing every flicker of the curtain, photographing everyone who called including the postman and the milkman.</p>
<p>‘What do they want with me?’ he screamed to himself inside his head. ‘Why are they persecuting me like this?’</p>
<p>He had no one to turn to, no one with whom to share his misery and offer consolation. He was a lonely figure, a sincere and even devout man who had made one mistake, and he knew sooner or later he must pay for it. His mother had always drilled into him the need to pay for one’s sins or be consumed by hell fire, and he felt the flames licking at him now with growing ferocity. .</p>
<p>He had been home half an hour on Monday evening when they knocked on the door.</p>
<p>‘Sorry to bother you, Mr Earle. Simmonds and Peters again. Just a quick question our editor wanted us to ask. How long have you known him?’</p>
<p>Into his face was thrust another photograph, still of Simon, but this time taken not at a public rally but in a photographer’s studio, and dressed from head to foot in black leather slashed by zip fasteners. The jacket was open to the waist, exposing a slender, tapering body, while from his right hand there trailed a long bullwhip.</p>
<p>‘Go away. Go away. Please - go away!’ he screamed, so loudly that neighbours came to the window to investigate. If it’s inconvenient, we’ll come back some other time, sir.’</p>
<p>Silently they filed back to their car, and resumed the watch.</p>
<p>￼TUESDAY 23rd NOVEMBER</p>
<p>They were still there the following morning. After yet another sleepless night, Earle knew he had no emotional resources left. With red eyes and husky voice, he sat weeping gently in an armchair in the study. He had worked so hard, deserved so much, yet it had all come to this. He had tried so desperately to deserve his mother’s love and commendation, to achieve something with which to illuminate her final years, but once again he had failed her, as she always said he would.</p>
<p>He knew he must finish it. There was no point in going on. He no longer believed in himself, and knew he had forfeited the right to have others believe in him. Through misty eyes he reached down into the drawer of his desk, and fumbled as he took out his private phone book. He punched the numbers on the phone as if they were nails being driven through his soul. He fought hard to control his voice throughout the brief conversation, but then it was finished, and he could weep again.</p>
<p>The news that Earle had pulled out of the race left everyone aghast as it flashed round Westminster later on Tuesday morning. It had happened so unexpectedly that there was no time to alter the printed ballot papers except with an ignominious scratching through of the name with a biro. Sir Humphrey was not best pleased that his carefully laid preparations should have been thrown into chaos at the last minute, and had some rough words to use for anyone who was willing to listen. But on the stroke of ten Committee Room Number 14, which had been set aside in the House of Commons for the ballot, opened its doors and the first of the 335 Government MPs who were going to vote began to file through. There would be two prominent absentees - the Prime Minister, who had announced he would not vote, and Harold Earle.</p>
<p>Mattie had intended to spend the whole day at the House of Commons chatting to MPs and gauging their sentiment. Most appeared to think that Earle’s withdrawal would tend to help Samuel as much as anyone: ‘the conciliators tend to stick with the conscience merchants’ one old buffer had explained, ‘so Earle’s supporters will drift towards young Disraeli. They haven’t got the sense to make any more positive decision.’ Behind the scenes and in private conversations with colleagues who could be trusted, the campaign was taking a more unpleasant personal edge.</p>
<p>She was in the press gallery cafeteria drinking coffee with other correspondents when the tannoy system announced there was a telephone call for her. She took it at the nearest extension. The sense of shock which hit her when she heard the voice was even greater than the news of Earle’s withdrawal.</p>
<p>‘Hello, Mattie. I understand you were looking for me last week. Sorry you missed me, I was out of the office. Touch of gastric ‘flu. Do you still want to get together?’</p>
<p>Roger O’Neill sounded so friendly and enthusiastic that she had trouble connecting it with the voice she had heard a few days earlier. Could it really have been O’Neill she had listened to drivelling down the phone? She remembered the reports about his outrageous performance at Urquhart’s reception in Bournemouth, and realised the man must be riding an emotional helter skelter, careering between highs and lows like a demented circus ride.</p>
<p>If you are still interested, perhaps you would like to come across to Smith Square later today’ he offered.</p>
<p>He showed no signs of the verbal bruising he had received from Urquhart, which had been particularly merciless. Urquhart had telephoned to instruct O’Neill to make the appropriate arrangements for Simon to attend Earle’s weekend meeting, and to ensure that the Minorwas anonymously informed of the connections between the two men. Instead he had discovered that O’Neill was sliding steadily into his cocaine-induced oblivion and losing touch with events outside his increasingly narrow, kaleidoscopic world. There had been a confrontation. Urquhart could not afford to lose O’Neill’s services inside party headquarters, or have loose ends unravelling at this point.</p>
<p>‘One week, Roger, one more week and you can take a break, forget about all of this for a while if you want, and come back to that knighthood you’ve always wanted. Yes, Roger, with a “K” they will never be able to look down their noses at you again. And I can arrange everything for you. But you let me down now, you lose control and I will make sure you regret it for the rest of your life. Damn you, get a grip on yourself. You’ve got nothing to fear. Just hold on for a few more days!’</p>
<p>O’Neill wasn’t absolutely sure what Urquhart was going on about; to be sure he had been a little unwell but his befuddled brain still refused to accept there was a major problem which he couldn’t handle. Why fill one’s life with doubts, especially about oneself? He could cope with it, particularly with a little help… Still, a few days more to realise all his ambitions, to get the public recognition he deserved, to wipe the condescending smiles off their faces, would be worth a little extra effort.</p>
<p>He had got back into the office to be told that Mattie had been looking for him, that she was asking questions about the Paddington accommodation address.</p>
