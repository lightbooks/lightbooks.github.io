          <p>I began spending several hours a week with those children and their parents. The mothers were all in their late teens or early twenties; most had spent their lives in Altgeld, raised by teenage mothers themselves. They spoke without self- consciousness about pregnancy at fourteen or fifteen, the dropping out of school, the tenuous links to the fathers who slipped in and out of their lives. They told me about working the system, which involved mostly waiting: waiting to see</p>
<p>the social worker, waiting at the currency exchange to cash their welfare checks, waiting for the bus that would take them to the nearest supermarket, five miles away, just to buy diapers on sale.</p>
<p>They had mastered the tools of survival in their tightly bound world and made no apologies for it. They weren’t cynical, though; that surprised me. They still had ambitions. There were girls like Linda and Bernadette Lowry, two sisters Dr. Collier had helped get high school equivalencies. Bernadette was now taking classes at the community college; Linda, pregnant again, stayed at home to look after Bernadette’s son, Tyrone, and her own daughter, Jewel-but she said she’d be going to college, too, once her new baby was born. After that they would both find jobs, they said-in food management, maybe, or as secretaries. Then they would move out of Altgeld. In Linda’s apartment one day, they showed me an album they kept full of clippings from Better Homes and Gardens. They pointed to the bright white kitchens and hardwood floors, and told me they would have such a home one day. Tyrone would take swimming lessons, they said; Jewel would dance ballet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, listening to such innocent dreams, I would find myself fighting off the urge to gather up these girls and their babies in my arms, to hold them all tight and never let go. The girls would sense that impulse, I think, and Linda, with her dark, striking beauty, would smile at Bernadette and ask me why I wasn’t already married.</p>
<p>“Haven’t found the right woman, I guess,” I would say.</p>
<p>And Bernadette would slap Linda on the arm, saying, “Stop it! You making Mr. Obama blush.” And they would both start to laugh, and I would realize that in my own way, I must have seemed as innocent to them as they both seemed to me.</p>
<p>My plan for the parents was simple. We didn’t yet have the power to change state welfare policy, or create local jobs, or bring substantially more money into the schools. But what we could do was begin to improve basic services in Altgeld-get the toilets fixed, the heaters working, the windows repaired. A few victories there, and I imagined the parents forming the nucleus of a genuinely independent tenants’ organization. With that strategy in mind, I passed out a set of complaint forms at the next full parents’ meeting, asking everyone to canvass the block where they lived. They agreed to the plan, but when the meeting was over, one of the parents, a woman named Sadie Evans, approached me holding a small newspaper clipping.</p>
<p>“I saw this in the paper yesterday, Mr. Obama,” Sadie said. “I don’t know if it means anything, but I wanted to see what you thought.”</p>
<p>It was a legal notice, in small print, run in the classified section. It said that the CHA was soliciting bids from qualified contractors to remove asbestos from Altgeld’s management office. I asked the parents if any of them had been notified about potential asbestos exposure. They shook their heads.</p>
<p>“You think it’s in our apartments?” Linda asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But we can find out. Who wants to call Mr. Anderson over at the management office?”</p>
<p>I glanced around the room, but no hands went up. “Come on, somebody. I can’t make the call. I don’t live here.” Finally Sadie raised her hand. “I’ll do it,” she said.</p>
<p>Sadie wouldn’t have been my first choice. She was a small, slight woman with a squeaky voice that made her seem</p>
<p>painfully shy. She wore knee-length dresses and carried a leather-bound Bible wherever she went. Unlike the other</p>
<p>parents, she was married, to a young man who worked as a store clerk by day but was training to be a minister; they didn’t associate with people outside their church.</p>
<p>All this made her something of a misfit in the group, and I wasn’t sure she’d be tough enough to deal with the CHA. But when I got back to the office that day, my secretary passed on the message that Sadie had already set up the appointment with Mr. Anderson and had called all the other parents to let them know. The following morning, I found Sadie standing out in front of the Altgeld management office, looking like an orphan, alone in the clammy mist.</p>
<p>“Don’t look like anybody else is showing up, does it, Mr. Obama?” she said, looking at her watch.</p>
<p>“Call me Barack,” I said. “Listen, do you still want to go through with this? If you’re not comfortable, we can reschedule the meeting until we have some other parents.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Do you think I can get in trouble?”</p>
<p>“I think you’ve got the right to information that could affect your health. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Anderson is gonna think so. I’ll stand behind you, and so will the other parents, but you need to do what makes sense for you.”</p>
<p>Sadie pulled her overcoat tightly around herself and looked again at her watch. “We shouldn’t keep Mr. Anderson waiting,” she said, and plunged through the door.</p>
<p>From the expression on Mr. Anderson’s face when we walked into his office, it was clear that I hadn’t been expected. He offered us a seat and asked us if we wanted some coffee.</p>
<p>“No thank you,” Sadie said. “I really appreciate you seeing us on such short notice.” With her coat still on, she pulled out the legal notice and set it carefully on Mr. Anderson’s desk. “Some of the parents at the school saw this in the paper, and we were worried…well, we wondered if this asbestos maybe was in our apartments.”</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson glanced at the notice, then set it aside. “This is nothing to worry about, Mrs. Evans,” he said. “We’re just doing renovation on this building, and after the contractors tore up one of the walls, they found asbestos on the pipes. It’s just being removed as a precautionary measure.”</p>
<p>“Well…shouldn’t the same thing, the same precautionary measures, I mean, be taken in our apartments? I mean, isn’t there asbestos there, too?”</p>
<p>The trap was laid, and Mr. Anderson’s eyes met mine. A cover-up would generate as much publicity as the asbestos, I had told myself. Publicity would make my job easier. And yet, as I watched Mr. Anderson shift around in his seat, trying to take measure of the situation, there was a part of me that wanted to warn him off. I had the unsettling feeling that his soul was familiar to me, that of an older man who feels betrayed by life-a look I had seen so often in my grandfather’s eyes. I wanted to somehow let Mr. Anderson know that I understood his dilemma, wanted to tell him that if he would just explain that the problems in Altgeld preceded him and admit that he, too, needed help, then some measure of salvation might alight in the room.</p>
<p>Instead, I said nothing, and Mr. Anderson turned away. “No, Mrs. Evans,” he said to Sadie. “There’s no asbestos in the residential units. We’ve tested them thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a relief,” Sadie said. “Thank you. Thank you very much.” She rose, shook Mr. Anderson’s hand, and started for the door. I was just about to say something when she turned back toward the project manager.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” she said. “I forgot to ask you something. The other parents…well, they’d like to see a copy of these tests you took. The results, I mean. You know, just so we can make everybody feel their kids are safe.”</p>
<p>“I…the records are all at the downtown office,” Mr. Anderson stammered. “Filed away, you understand.” “Do you think you can get us a copy by next week?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well…of course. I’ll see what I can do. Next week.”</p>
<p>When we got outside, I told Sadie she had done well.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. We’ll find out soon enough.”</p>
<p>A week passed. Sadie called Mr. Anderson’s office: She was told that the results would take another week to produce. Two weeks passed, and Sadie’s calls went unreturned. We tried to reach Mrs. Reece, then the CHA district manager, then sent a letter to the executive director of the CHA with a copy to the mayor’s office. No response.</p>
<p>“What do we do now?” Bernadette asked.</p>
<p>“We go downtown. If they won’t come to us, we’ll go to them.”</p>
<p>The next day we planned our action. Another letter to the CHA executive director was drafted, informing him that we</p>
<p>would appear at his office in two days to demand an answer to the asbestos question. A short press release was issued. The children of Carver were sent home with a flyer pinned to their jackets urging their parents to join us. Sadie, Linda, and Bernadette spent most of the evening calling their neighbors.</p>
<p>But when the day of reckoning arrived, I counted only eight heads in the yellow bus parked in front of the school. Bernadette and I stood in the parking lot trying to recruit other parents as they came to pick up their children. They said they had doctors’ appointments or couldn’t find baby-sitters. Some didn’t bother with excuses, walking past us as if we were panhandlers. When Angela, Mona, and Shirley arrived to see how things were shaping up, I insisted they ride with us to lend moral support. Everyone looked depressed, everyone except Tyrone and Jewel, who were busy making faces at Mr. Lucas, the only father in the group. Dr. Collier came up beside me.</p>
<p>“I guess this is it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Better than I expected,” she said. “Obama’s Army.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” she said, and clapped me on the back.</p>
<p>The bus rolled past the old incinerator and the Ryerson Steel plant, through Jackson Park, and then onto Lake Shore</p>
<p>Drive. As we approached downtown, I passed out a script for the action and asked everyone to read it over carefully. Waiting for them to finish, I noticed that Mr. Lucas had a deep frown carved into his forehead. He was a short, gentle man with a bit of a stutter; he did odd jobs around Altgeld and helped out the mother of his children whenever he could. I came up beside him and asked if something was wrong.</p>
<p>“I don’t read so good,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>We both looked down at the page of crowded type.</p>
<p>“That’s okay.” I walked to the front of the bus. “Listen up, everybody! We’re going to go over the script together to</p>
<p>make sure we’ve got it straight. What do we want?” “A meeting with the director!”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“In Altgeld!”</p>
<p>“What if they say they’ll give us an answer later?”</p>
<p>“We want an answer now!”</p>
<p>“What if they do something we don’t expect?”</p>
<p>“We caucus!”</p>
<p>“Crackers!” Tyrone shouted.</p>
<p>The CHA office was in a stout gray building in the center of the Loop. We filed off the bus, entered the lobby, and</p>
<p>mashed onto the elevator. On the fourth floor, we entered a brightly lit lobby where a receptionist sat behind an imposing desk.</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” she said, scarcely glancing up from her magazine. “We’d like to see the director, please,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“Do you have an appointment?”</p>
<p>“He…” Sadie turned to me.</p>
<p>“He knows we’re coming,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, he’s not in the office right now.”</p>
<p>Sadie said, “Could you please check with his deputy?”</p>
<p>The receptionist looked up with an icy stare, but we stood our ground. “Have a seat,” she said finally.</p>
