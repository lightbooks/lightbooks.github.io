          <p>The phone buzzed gently as the call was put through. ‘Dr Christian. How can I help you? And how is Charles?’ It’s about Charles I’m calling, Mr Collingridge. As we have discussed before, I have been keeping him very isolated and away from the newspapers so that he wasn’t disturbed by all the allegations. But we have a problem. Normally we switch his television off and find something to divert him during news programmes, but we weren’t expecting the unscheduled programme about your resignation - I’m deeply sorry you’ve had to resign, by the way, but it’s about Charles I am</p>
<p>￼most worried. I have to put his interests first, you understand.’</p>
<p>‘I do understand, Dr Christian, and you have your priorities absolutely right.’</p>
<p>‘He heard of the allegations about you and himself for the very first time, and how they had helped bring about your resignation. He is deeply upset and disturbed, Mr Collingridge; it’s come as a great shock. He believes he is to blame for all that’s happened, and I’m afraid is talking about doing harm to himself. I thought we were just on the verge of making real progress in his case, and now I fear this will not only set him right back but in his present delicate emotional state could bring about a real crisis for him. I don’t wish to alarm you unduly, but he needs your help. Very badly.’</p>
<p>Sarah saw the look of anguish on her husband’s face, and came over to sit beside him and hold his hand. It was trembling. ‘Doctor, what can I do? I’ll do anything, anything you want.’</p>
<p>‘We need to find some way of reassuring him. He’s desperately confused.’</p>
<p>There was a pause as Collingridge bit deep into his lip, hoping it would distract from the pain burning inside.</p>
<p>‘May I talk to him, doctor?’</p>
<p>There was a wait of several minutes as Charles was brought to the telephone.</p>
<p>‘Charlie, how are you old boy?’ he said softly.</p>
<p>Henry, what have I done to you? I’ve ruined you, destroyed you!’ The voice sounded old, touched by hysteria. ‘Charlie, Charlie. You’ve done nothing. It’s not you who has hurt me, you have nothing to feel guilty about’</p>
<p>‘But I’ve seen it on the television. You going off to the Queen to resign. They said it was because of me and some shares. I don’t understand it, Henry, I’ve screwed it all up. Not only my life, but you and Sarah too. I don’t deserve to be your brother. There’s no point in anything any more’ There was a huge, gulping sob on the end of the phone.</p>
<p>‘Charlie, I want you to listen to me very carefully. Are you listening? It’s not you who should be asking for pardon, but me who should be down on my knees begging for forgiveness from you’</p>
<p>He cut through the protest beginning to emerge from his brother.</p>
<p>‘No, listen, Charlie! We’ve always got through our problems together, as family. Remember when I was running the business - the year we nearly went bust? We were going down, Charlie, and it was my fault. And who brought in that new client, that order which saved us? I know it wasn’t the biggest order the company ever had, but it couldn’t have come at a more vital time. You saved the company, Charlie, and you saved me. Just like you did when I was a bloody fool and got caught driving over the limit that Christmas. The local police sergeant was a rugger playing friend of yours, not mine, and it was you who somehow managed to persuade him to fix- the breath test at the station. If I had lost my licence then, I would never have been selected by the constituency for the seat. Don’t you see, Charlie, far from ruining it for me, you made it all possible. We’ve always faced things together, and that’s just how it’s going to stay.’ ‘But now I’ve ruined everything for you, Henry.. ‘ ‘No, it’s me that’s ruined things. I got too high and bloody mighty, and forgot that the only thing that matters in the end is those you love. You were always around when I needed help, all the time. But I got too busy. When Mary left, I knew how much you were hurting. I should have been there. You needed me, but there always seemed other things to do. I was always going to come and see you tomorrow, or the next day. ‘Always tomorrow, Charlie, always tomorrow.’</p>
<p>The emotion was cracking Collingridge’s voice.</p>
<p>I’ve had my moment of glory, I’ve been selfish, I’ve done the things that I wanted to do. While I watched you become an alcoholic and practically kill yourself’</p>
<p>It was the first time that either of them had spoken that truth. Charles had always been under the weather, or overtired, or suffering from nerves - never uncontrollably, alcoholically drunk. They both knew there were no secrets now, no going back.</p>
<p>‘I will walk out of Downing Street and will be able to say good bloody riddance - if only I know I still have my brother. I’m just terrified, Charlie, that it’s too late, that I’ve neglected you too much to be able to ask for your forgiveness, that you’ve been alone too long for you to want to get better.’</p>
<p>The tears of genuine anguish were flowing down his cheeks. Sarah was hugging him tightly. ‘Charlie, without your forgiveness, all this will have been for nothing.’</p>
<p>There was silence from the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>‘Say something, Charlie!’ he said in desperation.</p>
<p>‘I love you, big brother.’</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of release and total joy.</p>
<p>‘I love you too, old boy. I’ll come and see you tomorrow. We’ll both have a lot more time for each other now, eh?’ They were both laughing through the tears, with Sarah joining in. Henry Collingridge hadn’t felt so whole for years.</p>
<p>￼She was sipping a drink, admiring the night view of London from his penthouse apartment when he came up behind her and embraced her warmly. Hey, I thought we came here to discuss business,’ she said, not resisting.</p>
<p>‘There are some things I don’t have the words for’ he said, burying his face in her blonde hair and rejoicing at its freshness.</p>
<p>She turned round in his arms to face him and look directly into his eyes.</p>
<p>‘You talk too much’ she said, and kissed him passionately. She was glad he had made the first move; she was not competing tonight, she wanted to be free, uncomplicated, just a woman.</p>
<p>She made no sound of protest as he slipped her silk blouse over her shoulders and it fell away, revealing a smooth and unblemished skin which could have been a model’s. Her breasts were immaculate, small but very feminine and sensitive. She gasped as his fingers gently ran over her nipples, which responded instantly. She undid her own belt and let her trousers fall straight to the floor, stepping out of them and out of her shoes in one graceful movement. She stood tall and unashamed against the glittering lights of London behind her.</p>
<p>He marvelled for a moment at what he saw. He couldn’t remember when he last had felt like this, so excited and so much a man.</p>
<p>‘Mattie, you look lovely.’</p>
<p>‘I hope you are not just going to look, Johnnie’ she said.</p>
<p>He took her to the fireplace where the flames flickered invitingly, held her close against him and prayed that the moment would last for ever. When they were spent, for some while they lay silently on the rug, lost in their thoughts and each other’s arms. It was Mattie who broke the spell. Is it all coincidence, Johnnie?’</p>
<p>‘Let’s try again and see.’</p>
<p>‘Not this, you fool,’ she laughed. ‘It’s time to talk now!’</p>
<p>‘Oh, I wondered how long it would take you to get back to that,’ he said with an air of resignation. He got them both blankets to wrap themselves in.</p>
<p>‘We find a plan, effort, plot - call it what you will in which our paper is involved, to chop the legs off Collingridge. For all we know it has been going on for months. Now Collingridge resigns. Is it all part of the same operation?’</p>
<p>‘How can it be, Mattie? In the end Collingridge hasn’t been forced out by his opponents but by his brother’s apparent fiddling of share purchases. You’re surely not suggesting all that was part of the plan.’</p>
<p>‘You have to admit it’s a hell of a coincidence, Johnnie. I’ve met Charles Collingridge, spent several hours drinking and chatting with him at the party conference, as it happens. He struck me as being a pleasant and straightforward drunk, who certainly didn’t seem as if he had two hundred pounds to put together, let alone being able to raise tens of thousands of pounds to start speculating in shares.’</p>
<p>Her face was screwed up in concentration as she grappled with her still confused thoughts. It may seem silly, I know he’s an alcoholic and they often aren’t responsible for their actions, but I don’t believe he would have jeopardised his brother’s whole career for a few thousand pounds’ profit on the Stock Market. And do you really think it’s likely that Henry Collingridge, the Prime Minister of this country, was feeding his drunk brother insider share tips to finance his boozing?’</p>
<p>Is it any more credible to believe there is some form of high-level plot involving senior party figures, the publisher of our newspaper and God knows who else to kill off the Prime Minister? Surely the easiest explanation is the simple one - that Charles Collingridge is a drunk who is not responsible for his actions and who has done something so overwhelmingly stupid that his brother’s had to resign.’</p>
<p>‘There’s only one person who can tell us, I suppose. Charles Collingridge.’</p>
<p>‘But he’s locked away in some clinic or other, isn’t he? I thought his whereabouts were a closely guarded family secret.’</p>
<p>True, but he’s the only one who could help us get to the bottom of this.’</p>
<p>‘And how does our Reporter of the Year propose to do that?’</p>
<p>he teased.</p>
<p>She was concentrating too intently to rise to the bait. Instead, she sat on the hearth rug wrapped deep in thought and an enormous yellow blanket while he refreshed their drinks. As he returned with two glasses, she spun round to face him.</p>
<p>‘When was the last time anyone saw Charles Collingridge?’ she demanded. ‘Why, er … When he was driven away from his home over a week ago.’ ‘Who was he with?’</p>
<p>‘Sarah Collingridge.’</p>
<p>‘And…?’</p>
<p>￼’A driver.’</p>
<p>‘Who was the driver, Johnnie?’</p>
<p>‘Damned if I know. Never seen him before. Hang on, being a dutiful deputy editor I keep all the nightly news on tape for a fortnight, so I should have it here somewhere.’</p>
<p>He rummaged around by his video player for a few moments before slotting a tape into the chamber and winding it forward. In a few seconds, through the blizzard produced by the fast replay button, appeared the scenes of Charles Collingridge huddled in the back of the fleeing car.</p>
<p>‘Go back!’ she ordered. ‘To the start.’</p>
<p>And there, for less than a second at the front of the report, as the car swept from behind the building into the main road, they could clearly see the face of the driver through the windscreen.</p>
<p>Krajewski punched the freeze frame button. They both sat there entranced, staring at the balding and bespectacled face.</p>
<p>‘And who the hell is he?’ muttered Krajewski.</p>
<p>‘Let’s figure out who he’s not’ said Mattie. ‘He’s not a</p>
<p>Government driver - it’s not a Government car and the drivers pool is very gossipy, so we would have heard something. He’s not a political figure or we would have recognised him…’</p>
<p>She clapped her hands in inspiration. ‘Johnnie, where were they going?’</p>
<p>‘Not to Downing Street, not to some hotel or other public place.’ He pondered the options. To the clinic, I suppose.’ ‘Precisely! That man is from the clinic. If we can find out who he is, we shall know where Charles is!’</p>
