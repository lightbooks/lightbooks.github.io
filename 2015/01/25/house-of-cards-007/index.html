          <p>The Prime Minister’s youthful political secretary was waiting at the end of the corridor which led away from the front door towards the Cabinet Room at the rear of the building. As Urquhart approached, he sensed that the young man was uneasy.</p>
<p>The PM is expecting you, Chief Whip’ he said quite unnecessarily. ‘He’s in the study upstairs. I’ll let him know you have arrived,’ and bounded off up the stairs.</p>
<p>It was a full twelve minutes before he reappeared, leaving Urquhart to stare for the hundredth time at the portraits of previous Prime Ministers which adorned the famous staircase. He could never get over the feeling of how inconsequential so many of the recent holders of the office had been. Uninspiring and unfitted for the task. Times had changed, and for the worse. The likes of Lloyd George and Churchill had been magnificent natural leaders, but one had been promiscuous and the other arrogant and often drunk, and neither would have been tolerated by the modern media in the search for sensationalism. The media’s prying and lack of charity had cast a blanket of mediocrity over most holders of the office since the war, stifling individualism and those with real inspiration. Collingridge, chosen largely for his television manner, typified how superficial much of modem politics had become, he thought. He yearned for the grand old days when politicians made their own rules rather than cowering before the rules laid down by the media.</p>
<p>The return of the political secretary interrupted his thoughts. ‘Sorry to keep you waiting, Chief Whip. He’s ready for you now.’</p>
<p>As Urquhart entered the room traditionally used by modern Prime Ministers as their study he could see that, in spite of efforts to tidy up the desk, there had been much shuffling of paper and scribbling of notes in the previous hour and a half. An empty bottle of claret stared out of the waste paper bin, and plates covered with crumbs and a withered leaf of lettuce lurked on the windowsill. The Party Chairman sat to the right of the Prime Minister’s desk, his notes spilled over the green leather top. Beside them stood a large pile of MPs’ biographies supplied by party headquarters.</p>
<p>Urquhart brought up a chair and sat in front of the other two, who were silhouetted against the sun as it shone in through the windows overlooking Horse Guards Parade. He squinted into the light, balancing his own folder of notes uneasily on his knee.</p>
<p>Without ceremony, Collingridge got straight down to business. ‘Francis, you were kind enough to let me have some thoughts on the reshuffle. I am very grateful; you know how useful such suggestions are in stimulating my own thoughts, and you have obviously put a lot of work into them. Now before we get down to the specific details, I thought it would be sensible just to chat about the broad objectives first. You’ve suggested - well, what shall I call it? - a rather radical reshuffle with six new members being brought into the Cabinet and some extensive swapping of portfolios amongst the rest. Tell me why you would prefer an extensive reshuffle and what you think it would achieve.’</p>
<p>Urquhart did not care for this. He had expected some inevitable discussion of individual appointments, but he was being asked to justify the</p>
<p>￼strategy behind the reshuffle proposals before he had any chance to sniff out the Prime Minister’s own views. He knew that it was not healthy for a Chief Whip to fail to read his Prime Minister’s mind correctly, and he wondered whether he was being set up.</p>
<p>As he peered into the sunlight streaming in from behind the Prime Minister, he could read nothing of the expression on Collingridge’s face. He desperately wished now that he had not committed all his thoughts to paper instead of talking them through, but it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p>‘Of course, they are only suggestions, indications really of what you might be able to do. I thought in general that it might be better to undertake more rather than fewer changes, simply to indicate that you are firmly in charge of the Government and that you are expecting a lot of new ideas and new thinking from your Ministers. And a chance to retire just a few of our older colleagues; regrettable, but necessary if you are to bring in some new blood and bring on those Junior Ministers who have shown most promise.’</p>
<p>Dammit, he thought suddenly, that was a stupid thing to say with that ancient bastard Williams sitting on the PM’s right hand. He knew he should have been more careful, and now he had a knot in the pit of his stomach. Collingridge had never seemed to be a Prime Minister with grip, one who enjoyed making decisions, and Urquhart had felt sure that most if not all of his proposals would be favourably received. All of his suggested promotions were men of talent which few would deny. He hoped that even fewer would realise that most were also men who owed him.</p>
<p>Ministers whom he had helped out of trouble, whose weaknesses he knew, whose sins he had covered up and whose wives and electors would never find out.</p>
<p>Williams was staring at him with his old, cunning eyes. Did he know, had he figured it out? The room was silent as the Prime Minister tapped his pencil on the desk, clearly having trouble with the argument Urquhart had put forward.</p>
<p>‘We’ve been in power for longer than any Party since the war, which presents a new challenge. Boredom. We need to ensure we have a fresh image for the Government team,’ Urquhart continued. ‘We must guard against going stale.’</p>
<p>That’s very interesting, Francis, and I agree with you to a large extent. Teddy and I have been discussing just that sort of problem. We must bring on a new generation of talent, find new impetus by putting new men in new places. And I find many of your suggestions for changes at the lower Ministerial levels below Cabinet very persuasive.’</p>
<p>‘But they are not the ones that matter,’ Urquhart muttered beneath his breath.</p>
<p>The trouble is that too much change at the top can be very disruptive. It takes most Cabinet Ministers a year simply to find their feet in a new Department, and a year is a long time to struggle through without being able to show positive signs of progress. Rather than Cabinet changes helping to implement our new programme, Teddy’s view is that on balance it would more likely delay the programme.’</p>
<p>What new programme?, Urquhart screamed inside his skull. We deliberately published the most flaccid and uncontroversial manifesto we could get away with! He calmed himself before responding.</p>
<p>‘Don’t you think by cutting our majority the electorate was telling us of its desire for some degree of change?’</p>
<p>‘An interesting point. But as you yourself said, no Government in our lifetimes has been in office as long as we have: Without in any way being complacent, Francis, I don’t think we could have rewritten the history books if die voters believed we had run out of steam. On balance, I think it suggests that they are content with what we offer, and there is no great sign of them demanding upheaval or change. There’s another vital point’ he continued, lust because our majority has been cut, we must avoid giving the impression that we are panicking. That would send entirely the wrong signal to the Party and the country, and could bring about just that demand for change which you are so nervous of. Remember that Macmillan destroyed his own Government by panicking and sacking a third of his Cabinet. “The Night of the Long Knives” they called it, and he was out of office the following year. That was a mistake I am not anxious to repeat. So I’m thinking of a much more controlled approach myself.’</p>
<p>Collingridge slipped a piece of paper across the desk towards Urquhart, who picked it up. On it was printed a list of Cabinet positions, twenty-two in all, with names alongside them.</p>
<p>‘As you see, Francis, I am suggesting no Cabinet changes at all. I hope it will be seen as a sign of great determination and strength. We have a job to do, and I think we should show we want to get straight on with it’</p>
<p>Urquhart quickly replaced the paper onto the desk, anxious that the tremble in his hand might betray his inner feelings.</p>
<p>If that is what you want, Prime Minister,’ he said, slipping into a formal tone. ‘I have to say that I am not sure how the Parliamentary Party will react. I’ve not had sufficient chance to take soundings since the election.’</p>
<p>I’m sure they will accept it. After all, we are proposing a substantial number of changes below Cabinet level to keep them happy’ There was the slightest pause. ‘And of course I assume I have your full support?’ he asked quizzically.</p>
<p>There was another pause, slightly longer this time, until Urquhart heard himself responding. ‘Of course, Prime Minister’</p>
<p>His own voice sounded strangely distant. He knew he had no choice: it was either support or suicide through instant resignation. The words of acceptance came out automatically, but without conviction. He felt the Whips Office closing around him like the walls of the condemned cell. Once again Urquhart felt uneasy in Collingridge’s presence, not knowing how to read him or how to respond to him. But he could not leave it there. His words faltered as he found his mouth suddenly dry.</p>
<p>‘I have to say that I… was rather looking for a change myself. A bit of new experience… a new challenge’</p>
<p>￼’Francis’ the Prime Minister said in his most reassuring manner, ‘if I move you, I have to move others. The whole pile of dominoes begins to fall over. And I need you where you are. You are an excellent Chief Whip. You have devoted yourself to burrowing right into the heart and soul of the Parliamentary Party. You know them so well, and we have to face it that with such a small majority there might be one or two sticky patches over the next few years. I need to have a Chief Whip who is strong enough to handle them. I need you, Francis. You are so good behind the scenes. We can leave it to others to do the job out front’</p>
<p>You appear to have made up your mind’ Urquhart said, hoping that it sounded like a statement of fact rather than the accusation which he felt. ‘I have’ replied the Prime Minister. ‘And I am deeply grateful that I can rely on your understanding and support.’</p>
<p>Urquhart felt the cell door slam shut. He thanked them, cast a dark eye at the Party Chairman, and took his farewell. Williams hadn’t uttered a single word.</p>
<p>He left through the basement of Number Ten which led him past the ruins of the old Tudor tennis court to the Cabinet Office, which faces onto Whitehall. He was well out of sight of die waiting press. He couldn’t face them. He had been with the Prime Minister less than half an hour, and he did not trust his face to back up the lies he would have to tell them. He got a security guard at the Cabinet Office to telephone for his car to be brought round.</p>
<p>The battered BMW had been standing outside the house in Cambridge Street, Pimlico for almost a quarter of an hour. Amidst the chaos of discarded newspapers and granary bar wrappers which covered the vacant seats, Mattie Storin sat biting her lip. Ever since the reshuffle announcement from Downing Street late that afternoon, fevered discussions had been undertaken in editorial offices trying to decide whether the Prime Minister had been brilliant and audacious or simply lost his nerve,- they needed the views of the men who had helped shape the decisions. Williams had been persuasive and supportive as usual, but Urquhart’s phone had only rung and rung.</p>
