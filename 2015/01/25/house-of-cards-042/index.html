          <p>The stag edged closer towards him as it continued to browse, oblivious of his presence. Suddenly, Urquhart stood bolt upright, not twenty yards in front of the deer which froze in confusion. Neither breathed as they stood in confrontation, until Urquhart let forth a peal of almighty laughter, racking his body with the sound which bounced off the surrounding banks of mist. The stag, sensing that it should already have been dead, leapt to one side and in an instant was gone.</p>
<p>Urquhart spent all morning walking through the woodlands and across the downs, not returning home until almost noon. When he did so, he walked straight into his study without changing, and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>He first called the editors of the four leading Sunday newspapers. He discovered that two of them were writing editorials supporting him, one was supporting Samuel and the other was noncommittal. However, all four were confident in varying degrees that he had a clear advantage, a conclusion confirmed by the Observer’s pollsters who by now had succeeded in contacting a substantial majority of the Parliamentary Party. The survey predicted that Urquhart would win comfortably with 60 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>It seems it would take an earthquake to stop you winning now, Francis’the editor had said. He then called a Kent number, and asked to be put through to Dr Christian.</p>
<p>‘Good afternoon, Chief Whip. Nice of you to take time out of your weekend to enquire about Charles. He is progressing very well indeed, I’m delighted to say. His brother the Prime Minister is down here almost every other day to see him, and it’s been like a tonic to both of them’</p>
<p>There’s something else I wanted to ask you, doctor. I need your advice. We have a Member of Parliament who has a real problem. He’s a cocaine addict, and recently his behaviour has deteriorated rapidly. His physical mannerisms - the nasal problems, exaggerated eye movements -have become much worse. His speech varies between a chaotic cavalry charge and a slow, incomprehensible drool. He has become very agitated and disturbed and has caused several public scenes. He has grown utterly paranoid, making wild accusations and threats. The man is clearly very ill, and I am trying to persuade him to take treatment but, as you keep telling me, addicts are often the last people to face up to their problems.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he occupies a very sensitive position of considerable trust. It could inflict untold damage if he were to break that trust and be indiscreet. The question I have for you, doctor, is to what extent a man in that situation is able to keep his word and any sense of perspective. Is there any chance we can trust him?’</p>
<p>‘You sound as if you have a very sick man on your hands, Mr Urquhart. By the time he is unable to keep his behaviour private but makes a public exhibition of himself on a regular basis, showing those sort of physical symptoms, then he is in the final stages of collapse. He is probably taking the drug several times every day, which means he’s not only unable to do his work but—much more seriously from your point of view — has lost all self restraint. The habit is very expensive and he will do anything to continue his supply of drugs. lie, steal, cheat, sometimes kill. He will sell anything he can lay his hands on in exchange for drugs, which includes any information he may have. He will also be getting very paranoid, and if you try to persuade him too hard to seek treatment against his will, he may turn on you as a vicious enemy and do anything to destroy you. I have seen it tear husbands from their wives and mothers from their children. They are driven by a need which stretches far beyond all others’</p>
<p>‘He’s already threatened to break the deepest confidences. Are you saying he might be serious about that?’ ‘Deadly serious’</p>
<p>‘Then we have a problem’</p>
<p>‘A very considerable one, by the sounds of it. I’m sorry. Please let me know if I can help’</p>
<p>‘You already have, doctor. Thank you.’</p>
<p>Urquhart was still sitting in his study when he heard O’Neill’s car draw up in the driveway outside.</p>
<p>￼As the Irishman stepped into the hallway, Urquhart could not help but note that the man who now stood in front of him was almost unrecognisable as the man he had taken to dinner in his club less than six months before. The casual elegance which O’Neill used to effect had now turned into outright scruffiness. His hair was unkempt, the clothes were badly creased as if he had found them at the bottom of a laundry bag, the tie hung loosely round the unbuttoned and crumpled collar. Trying to look at O’Neill as if meeting him for the first time, Urquhart was shocked. The gradual decline over several months had become part of O’Neill’s pattern for those colleagues who saw him frequently, and had largely hidden the true extent to which he had deteriorated. The once suave and fashionable communicator now looked like a common tramp. And those deep, twinkling eyes, the features which women had found so captivating and clients so enthusing, had sunk without trace, to be replaced by two wild, staring orbs which flashed around the room in constant pursuit of something they could never find. This was a man possessed.</p>
<p>Urquhart led O’Neill to one of the second floor guest rooms, saying little as they wound their way through the mansion’s long corridors while O’Neill babbled away about whatever came into his mind. Increasingly in recent days his conversation had turned to others and their opinion of him; in O’Neill’s mind the whole world seemed slowly and unjustly to be turning on him, betraying him. His Chairman, his Prime Minister, his secretary now. Even his local policeman seemingly patrolled the street for no other purpose than to spy on O’Neill, waiting to pounce on him.</p>
<p>O’Neill threw his overnight bag carelessly on the bed, showing little interest in the room and its fine views across the New Forest</p>
<p>scenery.They returned the way they had come down two flights of stairs until Urquhart led him through the heavy oak doors into his book-lined study. He suggested O’Neill help himself to a drink, and watched with clinical concentration as O’Neill filled the entire tumbler with whisky and began draining it Soon the alcohol had begun to do battle with the cocaine, and the raging in O’Neill’s eyes became just a touch less frenetic even as his tongue became thicker and his conversation began increasingly to lose its coherence. Depressant fought stimulant inside him, never achieving peace or balance, always leaving him on the point of toppling backwards or forwards into the abyss.</p>
<p>‘Roger,’ began Urquhart, ‘it looks as if we shall be in Downing Street by the end of the week. I’ve been doing some thinking about what I shall need, and I thought we might talk about what you wanted.’</p>
<p>O’Neill took another gulp before answering.</p>
<p>‘Francis, I’m bowled over that you should be thinking of me. You’re going to be a class act as Prime Minister, really you are. As it happens, I’ve also been giving some thought to it all, and I was wondering whether you could use someone like me in Downing Street — you know, as a special adviser or even your press spokesman. You’re going to need a lot of help and we seem to have worked so well together that I thought…’</p>
<p>Urquhart waved his hand for silence. ‘Roger, there are scores of civil servants to take on those responsibilities, people who are already doing that work. ‘What I need is someone like you in charge of the political propaganda, who can supplement the civil service properly and can be trusted to avoid all those mistakes which the party organisation has been making in recent months. I would very much like you to stay at party headquarters— under a new Chairman, of course’</p>
<p>A look of concern furrowed O’Neill’s brow. The same meaningless job, watching from the sidelines as the civil service ran the show, as aloof as he thought they were incompetent? What the devil was in it for him?</p>
<p>‘But to do something like that effectively, Francis, I shall need support, some special status. I… thought we had mentioned a knighthood.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, indeed, Roger. That would be no more than you deserve. You’ve been absolutely indispensable to me, and you must understand how grateful I am. But I’ve been making enquiries. That sort of honour may not be possible, at least in the short term. There are so many who are already in line to be honoured when a Prime Minister retires and a new Government comes in, and as you know there is a limit on the number of honours even a Prime Minister can hand out. I’m afraid it could take a while…’</p>
<p>Urquhart was determined to test O’Neill, to bully him, disappoint him, torment him, subject him to all the pressures he would inevitably come under in the course of the next few months, trying to see how far O’Neill could be pushed before reaching the limit. He had not a moment longer to wait as the Irishman hit his limit and burst through it with volcanic passion.</p>
<p>‘Francis, you promised! That was part of the deal! You gave your word, and now you’re telling me it’s not on. No job. No knighthood. Not now, not soon, not ever! You’ve got what you wanted and now you think you can get rid of me. Well, think again! I’ve lied, I’ve cheated, I’ve forged and I’ve stolen for you. Now you treat me just like all the rest. I’m not going to have people laughing at me behind my back any more and looking down their noses as if I were some smelly Irish peasant. I deserve that knighthood and I demand it!’</p>
<p>The tumbler was emptied and O’Neill, shaking with emotion, refilled it from the decanter, spilling the malt whisky as it flowed over the edge of the glass. He slurped a huge mouthful down before resuming his avalanche of anger.</p>
<p>‘We’ve been through this all together, as a team. Everything I’ve done has been for you, and you wouldn’t have been able to get into Downing Street without me. We succeed together- or we fail together. If I’m going to end up on the compost heap, Francis, I’m damned if I’m going to be there alone. You can’t afford to let me tell what I know. You owe me!’</p>
<p>The words had been spoken, the threat made. Urquhart had offered O’Neill a gauntlet of provocation, which almost without pause had been picked up and slapped back into Urquhart’s face. It was clear it was no longer a matter of whether O’Neill would lose control, but how quickly, and it had taken no time at all.</p>
<p>There was no point in continuing to test him, and Urquhart brought it to a rapid conclusion with a broad smile and shake of the head.</p>
<p>‘Roger, my dear friend. You misunderstand me entirely. I am only saying that it will be difficult this time around, in the New Year’s Honours List But there’s another one in the Spring, for the Queen’s Birthday. Just a few weeks away, really. I’m only asking you to wait until then. And if you want a job in Downing Street, then we shall find one. We work as a team, you and I. You have deserved it, and on my word of honour I will not forget what I owe you.’</p>
<p>￼O’Neill could not respond above a murmur. His passion had been spent, the alcohol burrowing its way into his nervous system, his emotions torn asunder and now pasted back together. He sat there drained, ashen, exhausted.</p>
<p>‘Look, have a sleep before lunch. We can sort out precisely what you want later,’ suggested Urquhart.</p>
