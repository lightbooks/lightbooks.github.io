          <p>And she was also lonely. Her bed was once more an Arctic outpost fit only for penguins, and gave her no comfort from her other problems.</p>
<p>Yet the story kept taking over and pushing to one side</p>
<p>any thoughts of dismay in her mind, while the Telegraph’s editorial intervention had given it a totally new twist. Throughout the early evening she had watched the various television news programmes, all of which were dominated by speculation as to whether Urquhart would stand, and informing a generally unaware audience about what a</p>
<p>￼Chief Whip actually does and who Urquhart was.</p>
<p>She needed to talk, and without wishing to question too deeply the conflicting emotions which were tangling in her</p>
<p>mind she found herself waiting on a wooden platform which bobbed in the Thames tide alongside Charing Cross</p>
<p>pier. Just a few minutes later she could see the approach of</p>
<p>the Telegraph’s private river taxi which shuttled employees between the newspaper’s dockland plant downstream and the rather more central and civilised reaches of the capital.</p>
<p>As she had hoped, Krajewski was on board. He said nothing as he found her standing on the pier, but accepted her silent invitation to walk.</p>
<p>It was a dry and clear November night, so they wrapped</p>
<p>up warm and without speaking strolled along the Embankment, tracing the sharp curves of the river bank and with it the floodlit vistas of the Festival Hall and the Houses of Parliament beyond, with the tower of Big Ben looking</p>
<p>down from high above. It was some time before he broke the silence. No questions about the other night, he decided. He knew what was foremost in her mind.</p>
<p>‘So what do you make of it all?’</p>
<p>She smiled shyly in gratitude for the lifeline, for not demanding an explanation of her motives which she would not - or was it could not? - give.</p>
<p>It’s extraordinary. They’re building him up like a Messiah on a white charger galloping to the rescue. Why did Grev do it?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know. He just came in late yesterday, not a word to anyone, turned the paper inside out and produced his</p>
<p>front page editorial from out of his pocket. No warning; no explanation. Still, seems to have caused quite a story. Perhaps he got it right after all.’</p>
<p>Mattie shook her head. It wasn’t Grev. He’s not capable of making a decision like that. It took balls to position’ - she almost used the word ‘commit’ but stopped herself just in time - ‘to position the paper in that way, and it could only have come from one place: the desk of our – your beloved proprietor, Mr Landless. Last time he interfered he was dethroning Collingridge, now he’s trying to hand the crown to someone else.’</p>
<p>As they traced their way along the winding river bank, they kicked through the windswept piles of leaves and passed by the pale, massive bulk of the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>‘But why? Why Urquhart?’</p>
<p>‘No idea,’ Mattie responded. ‘Urquhart is very low profile, although he’s been in the House for many years. He</p>
<p>comes across as being vaguely aristocratic, patrician, old school tie. He’s something of a loner, certainly not one of the boys, which means he’s got no great fan club but also no one hates him enough to campaign against him as they are doing with Samuel. Nobody knows what his views really are, he’s never had to express them as Chief Whip.’</p>
<p>She turned to face him. You know, he might just slip through the middle as the man the others dislike least. Landless could have picked a winner.’ ‘You think hell stand, then?’</p>
<p>‘Certain of it. He told me way back in June that there was going to be a leadership race, and he flatly refused then to rule himself out. He wants it all right, and he’ll stand.’</p>
<p>That sounds like a great feature - ‘The Man Who Saw It Coming’’.’ If only I had a paper to write it for,’ she said with a wistful smile.</p>
<p>He stopped and looked at Mattie, her fair hair glowing in the lights which bounced back from the soft yellow stone of the Houses of Parliament behind her, wondering if he detected a hint of regret in her voice.</p>
<p>‘Grev refuses to print your story and then announces the paper’s support for Urquhart Defusing one bomb and then launching another. Isn’t that a bit of a coincidence?’</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about that all day,’ she said. ‘The simple explanations are always the easiest to accept, and</p>
<p>the simple fact is that Grev Preston is a pathetic excuse for</p>
<p>an editor who is terrified of getting anything wrong. Knowing that Landless was going to throw Urquhart’s hat into</p>
<p>the ring, he didn’t have the nerve to upset his proprietor’s plans and I suspect he found my story simply too hot to handle.’</p>
<p>‘So you think Landless may be at the bottom of it all?’</p>
<p>It’s possible. He certainly welcomed the leadership contest, but then so did many others. Urquhart told me the weekend after the election of all the internal rivalry and bitterness inside the Government. Whoever is stirring it behind the scenes, we have the entire Cabinet to choose from, as well as Landless. And I am going to find out who.’</p>
<p>‘But how, without a newspaper?’</p>
<p>‘Preston has been stupid enough to insist that I shall remain employed by the Telegraph for another three months. OK. They may not print it, but I’m still a journalist and I can still ask questions. If the truth is half as devious as I suspect it is, the story will still he worth printing in three months’ or even three years’ time. They can’t lock up the truth for ever. I may have lost my job, Johnnie, but I haven’t lost my curiosity.’</p>
<p>And what about your commitment? he asked silently.</p>
<p>‘And will you be my spy on the inside, keeping an eye on what that bastard Landless is up to?’ He nodded, wondering just how much she was using him.</p>
<p>Thanks, Johnnie,’ she whispered. She squeezed his hand, and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>TUESDAY 16th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>The following day’s news was still being dominated by intense speculation as to whether Urquhart would run. It was clear that the media had excited itself to the point where they would feel badly let down if he didn’t, yet at</p>
<p>3 p.m. he was still keeping his own counsel. By this time, Mattie was feeling irked, not by Urquhart but by O’Neill. She had been waiting in his office with growing impatience for a full half hour.</p>
<p>When she had telephoned party headquarters the previous day wanting to get an official view about computers,</p>
<p>literature sales, accounting procedures, Charles Collingridge and all the other things which were bothering her, she</p>
<p>discovered that Spence had been absolutely right about the ban on staff contact with the media for the duration of the</p>
<p>campaign. She could only deal with the press office, and no press officer seemed capable or willing to talk to her about computers or accounts.</p>
<p>‘Sounds as if you are investigating our expenses,’ a voice only half-jokingly had said down the telephone.</p>
<p>So she had asked for the Director of Publicity’s office, and had been put through to Penny Guy. Mattie asked to come and talk the following morning with O’Neill, whom she had met a couple of times at receptions.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry, Miss Storin, but Mr O’Neill likes to keep his mornings free to clear his paper work and for internal</p>
<p>meetings.’ It was a lie, and one she was increasingly forced to use as O’Neill’s time keeping had become spectacularly</p>
<p>erratic. He rarely came into the office before ‘I p.m. nowadays. ‘How about 2.30 in the afternoon?’ she had suggested, playing safe.</p>
<p>She did not comprehend the mind-pulverising effects of cocaine, which kept O’Neill hyperactive and awake well into the small hours, unable to sleep until a cascade of depressant drugs had gradually overwhelmed the cocaine and forced him into an oblivion from which he did not return before midday or later. She did not comprehend this, but she suffered deeply from it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Now she was getting increasingly embarrassed as Mattie sat waiting for O’Neill. He had promised his secretary faithfully he would be on time, but as the wall clock ticked remorselessly on, her ability to invent new excuses disappeared completely. Her faith in O’Neill, with his public bravado and his private remorse, his inexplicable behaviour and his irrational outbursts, was slowly and painfully fading.</p>
<p>She brought Mattie yet another cup of coffee.</p>
<p>‘let me give him a call at home. Perhaps he’s had to go back there. Something he forgot, or not feeling too well…’</p>
<p>She sat on the corner of his desk, picked up the direct line and punched the numbers. With some embarrassment she greeted Roger on the phone, explaining that Mattie had been waiting for more than half an hour and … Her face became gradually more concerned, then anguished and finally horrified before she dropped the phone and fled from the office as if pursued by demons.</p>
<p>Mattie watched these happenings with complete astonishment, rooted to her chair, clutching her saucer, unable to speak or move. As the door banged shut behind the fleeing secretary she rose and moved over to the phone, picking the dangling receiver up from where it was swinging beside the desk and putting it to her ear.</p>
<p>The voice coming out of the phone was unrecognisable as that of O’Neill, or indeed anyone. The words were incoherent, indecipherable, slowed and slurred to the point where it sounded like a doll with the batteries almost dead. There were gasps, moans, long pauses, the sound of tears.</p>
<p>falling, and of a man falling apart She replaced the receiver gently in the cradle.</p>
<p>Mattie went in search of the secretary, and found her washing her face in the cloakroom. Her eyes were red and swollen. Mattie put a consoling arm around her shoulders.</p>
<p>‘How long has he been like that, Penny?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t say anything!’ she blurted, and started weeping once more.</p>
<p>‘Look, Penny, he’s obviously in a very bad way. I’m not going to print any of this, for goodness sake. I would like to help.’</p>
<p>The other girl turned towards Mattie, fell into her arms, let the pain and worry of the last few months gush out, and sobbed until there were no more tears left.</p>
<p>When she had recovered sufficiently to escape from the cloakroom, Mattie took her gently by the arm and they went for a walk in nearby Victoria Gardens, where they could refresh themselves in the cold, vigorous air blowing off the Thames and talk without interruption. Penny told her how the Prime Minister’s resignation had deeply upset O’Neill, how he had always been a little ‘emotionally extravagant’, as she put it, and the recent internal party turmoil and Prime Minister’s resignation had really brought him close to a breakdown.</p>
<p>‘But why, Penny? Surely they weren’t that close?’</p>
<p>‘He liked to think he was close to the whole Collingridge family. He was always arranging for flowers and special photographs to be sent to Mrs Collingridge, doing little favours whenever he could. He loved it all.’</p>
<p>Mattie shrugged her shoulders, as if she were shrugging off O’Neill’s reputation once and for all. It’s a great pity, of course, that he should be so weak and go to pieces just when the Party needs him most. But we both heard him this afternoon, Penny. Something has really got to Roger, something which is eating away at him from the inside.’</p>
<p>Mattie threw down the challenge. It wasn’t fair, of course, but she gambled that Penny would not stand by and see O’Neill accused of weakness. She would loyally try to defend her boss - and would not lie in order to do so.</p>
