          <p>When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written byoneTryon,recommendingavegetablediet.Ideterminedtogointoit. My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded him- self and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh occa- sioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon’s manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books. But I had another advan- tage in it. My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light re- past, which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook’s, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usu- ally attend temperance in eating and drinking.</p>

<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham’d of my ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at school, I took Cocker’s book of Arithmetick, and went through the whole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller’s and Shermy’s books of Naviga- tion, and became acquainted with the little geometry they contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read about this time Locke On Human Understanding, and the Art of Thinking, by Messrs. du Port Royal.</p>
<p>While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English grammar (I think it was Greenwood’s), at the end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon after I procur’d Xenophon’s Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there are many instances of the same method. I was charm’d with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from reading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very embar- rassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it, practis’d it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved. I continu’d this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any oth- ers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I con- ceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. This habit, I believe, has been of great advan- tage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and per- suade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag’d in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming man- ner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may pro-</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>voke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish informa- tion and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix’d in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably leave you un- disturbed in the possession of your error. And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to per- suade those whose concurrence you desire. Pope says, judiciously:</p>
<p>“Men should be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown propos’d as things forgot;”</p>
<p>farther recommending to us</p>
<p>“To speak, tho’ sure, with seeming diffidence.”</p>
<p>And he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with another, I think, less properly,</p>
<p>“For want of modesty is want of sense.”</p>
<p>If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,</p>
<p>“Immodest words admit of no defense, For want of modesty is want of sense.”</p>
<p>Now, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it) some apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines stand more justly thus?</p>
<p>“Immodest words admit but this defense, That want of modesty is want of sense.”</p>
<p>This, however, I should submit to better judgments.</p>
<p>My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was</p>
<p>the second that appeared in America, and was called the New England Courant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remem- ber his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for America. At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>composing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed to carry the papers thro’ the streets to the customers.</p>
<p>He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus’d themselves by writing little pieces for this paper, which gain’d it credit and made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their con- versations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call’d in as usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I then esteem’d them.</p>
<p>Encourag’d, however, by this, I wrote and convey’d in the same way to the press several more papers which were equally approv’d; and I kept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to be considered a little more by my brother’s acquaintance, and in a manner that did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time. Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice, and accordingly, expected the same services from me as he would from another, while I thought he demean’d me too much in some he requir’d of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a man- ner unexpected.*</p>
<p>One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up,</p>
<ul>
<li>I fancy his harsh and tyrannical treatment of me might be a means of impress- ing me with that aversion to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my whole life.</li>
</ul>
<p>￼19</p>
<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>censur’d, and imprison’d for a month, by the speaker’s warrant, I suppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up and examin’d before the council; but, tho’ I did not give them any satisfaction, they content’d themselves with admonishing me, and dismissed me, consider- ing me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound to keep his master’s secrets.</p>
<p>During my brother’s confinement, which I resented a good deal, not- withstanding our private differences, I had the management of the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my brother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libelling and satyr. My brother’s discharge was accompany’d with an order of the House (a very odd one), that “James Franklin should no longer print the paper called the New England Courant.”</p>
<p>There was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends, what he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be printed for the future under the name of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return’d to me, with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign new inden- tures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately executed, and the pa- per went on accordingly, under my name for several months.</p>
<p>At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture to produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my life; but the un- fairness of it weighed little with me, when under the impressions of re- sentment for the blows his passion too often urged him to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur’d man: perhaps I was too saucy and provoking.</p>
<p>When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting employment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and speaking to every master, who accordingly refus’d to give me work. I then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there was a printer; and I was rather inclin’d to leave Boston when I reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party, and,</p>
