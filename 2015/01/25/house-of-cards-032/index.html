          <p>‘Look, Mattie. Let’s not be hasty. Let’s be mature about this - friends! I want you to get wider experience on the</p>
<p>paper, you’ve got talent, even if I think you haven’t quite fitted in on the political side. We want to keep you here, so</p>
<p>think over the weekend what other part of the paper you might like to work on.’ He saw her steely, determined eyes</p>
<p>and knew it wasn’t working. ‘But if you really feel you must go, don’t rush into anything. Sort out what you want</p>
<p>to do, let me know, we’ll try to assist you and give you six months’ salary to help you on your way. I don’t want any hard feelings. Think about it.’</p>
<p>I’ve thought about it. And if you are not printing my story, I’m resigning. Here and now.’</p>
<p>She had never seen him so apoplectic. His words came spitting out. In which case I must remind you that your contract of employment stipulates that you must give me three months’ notice of departure, and that until that time has elapsed we retain exclusive rights over all your journalistic work If you insist, we shall rigidly enforce that provision, in the courts if necessary which would ruin your career once and for all. Face it, your copy isn’t going to get printed here or anywhere else. Wise up, Mattie, accept the offer. It’s the best one you are going to get!’</p>
<p>She knew now what her grandfather must have felt as he set out from his fishing village on the Norwegian fjord, knowing that once he had started he could never turn back even though ahead of him lay enemy patrol boats, mine fields, and nearly a thousand miles of hostile, stormy seas. She would need some of his courage, and his good fortune.</p>
<p>She gathered up the papers on Preston’s desk and ripped them slowly in half before letting them flutter back into his lap.</p>
<p>‘You can keep the words. But you don’t own the truth. I’m not sure you would even recognise it. I still quit.’ This time she slammed the door.</p>
<p>SUNDAY 14th NOVEMBER -MONDAY 15th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>Some two weeks earlier, immediately after the Telegraph had published the Landless opinion poll, Urquhart in his</p>
<p>capacity as Chief Whip had written to all of his parliamentary colleagues on the weekly Whips7 circular which is sent to party MPs.</p>
<p>During the course of the leadership election, newspapers and opinion pollsters will undoubtedly be</p>
<p>trying to obtain your view as to whom you are likely to support. I would encourage you not to cooperate,</p>
<p>since at best the results of these surveys can only ‘ serve to disrupt the proper conduct of what is supposed to be a confidential ballot, and at worst will be used by the less responsible press to make mischief</p>
<p>and subject our affairs to lurid headlines and comment. The best interests of the Party can only be served by discouraging such activity.</p>
<p>The majority of the Parliamentary Party was more than happy to cooperate, although it is a well established fact that at least a third of MPs are constitutionally incapable of keeping anything quiet, even state secrets.</p>
<p>As a result, the two opinion polls which appeared in the Sunday press following Mattie’s abrupt departure from Preston’s office were profoundly incomplete, leaving the pollsters scratching their heads at the Telegraph’s earlier persuasiveness. Less than 40 per cent of the 337 Government MPs who constituted the electorate for the ballot had responded to the polling companies’ pestering telephone calls, which gave the impression that the Parliamentary</p>
<p>Party was still a long way from making up its mind. Moreover, the small sample of those who had agreed to</p>
<p>respond gave no clear indication as to the likely result. Samuel was ahead, but only narrowly and to a degree which the pollsters emphasised was ‘not statistically significant’. Woolton, McKenzie and Earle followed in close order, with the four other declared candidates a little further behind.</p>
<p>The conclusions to be drawn from such insubstantial evidence were flimsy, but made excellent headlines, just four days before the close of nominations.</p>
<p>‘Samuel slipping - early lead lost’, roared the Mail on Sunday, while the Observer was scarcely less restrained in declaring ‘Party in turmoil as poll reveals great uncertainty’.</p>
<p>Tlie inevitable result was a flurry of editorials hostile to the Party, criticising both the quality of the candidates and their campaigns. ‘This country has a right to expect more of the governing Party than the undignified squabbling we have been subjected to in recent days and the lacklustre and uninspired manner in which it is deciding its fate,’</p>
<p>the Sunday Express intoned. ‘We may be witnessing a governing Party which is finally running out of steam,</p>
<p>ideas and leadership after too long in power.’</p>
<p>The following day’s edition of the Daily Telegraph was intended to resolve all that. Just three days before the close</p>
<p>of nominations, it put aside convention and for the first time in its history ran its editorial on the front page. Its</p>
<p>print run was increased and a copy was hand delivered to the London addresses of all Government MPs. No punches were pulled in its determination to make its views heard throughout the corridors of Westminster.</p>
<p>This paper has consistently supported the Government, not through blind prejudice but because we felt that they served the interests of the nation better than the alternatives. Throughout the Thatcher years our convictions were well supported by the progress which was made in restoring the economy to health and the inroads which began to be made in some of the more pressing social problems.</p>
<p>In recent months we began to feel that Henry Collingridge was not the best leader to write the next</p>
<p>chapter, and we supported his decision to resign. However, there is now a grave danger that the lack of judgement being shown by all the present contenders for his job will threaten a return to the bad old ways of weakness and indecisiveness which we hoped had been left behind for good.</p>
<p>Instead of the steadying hand which we need oh the tiller in order to consolidate the economic and social</p>
<p>advances of recent years, we have so far been offered a</p>
<p>choice between youthful inexperience, environmental upheaval and injudicious outbursts bordering ‘ on racial intolerance.</p>
<p>This choice is insufficient. The Government and the country need a leader who has maturity, who has</p>
<p>a sense of discretion, who has a proven capacity for working with all his colleagues in the Parliamentary Party.</p>
<p>There is at least one senior figure in the Party who not only enjoys all of these attributes, but who in recent weeks has been almost unique in remembering the need to uphold the dignity of Government and who, so rare in present day politics, has shown himself capable of putting aside his own personal ambition for what he perceives as being the wider interests of his Party.</p>
<p>He has announced that it is not his intention to seek election as Leader of the Party, but he still has time to reconsider before nominations close on Thursday. We believe it would be in the best interests of all concerned if the Chief Whip, Francis Urquhart, were to stand and to be elected.</p>
<p>There were forty press, television and radio men waiting outside Urquhart’s home in Cambridge Street when he emerged at 8.10 that morning. He had been waiting rather nervously inside, wanting to ensure that the timing of his exit enabled BBC radio’s Today programme and all breakfast television channels to take it live. Attracted by the scramble of newsmen, a host of passers-by and commuters from nearby Victoria Station had gathered to discover the cause for the commotion, and the live television pictures suggested a crowd showing considerable interest in the</p>
<p>man who now emerged onto the doorstep, looking down on the throng.</p>
<p>The shouted questions from the journalists were identical, and he waved a hand to quieten them so that his</p>
<p>answer could be heard. The hand also contained a copy of that morning’s Telegraph, and for a moment it looked as if he were giving a victory salute which only encouraged the scramble still further, but eventually he managed to bring a degree of calm to the proceedings.</p>
<p>‘Ladies and Gentlemen, as Chief Whip I would like to think you had gathered here because of your interest in</p>
<p>the details of the Government’s forthcoming legislative programme, but I suspect you have other things on your mind.’</p>
<p>The gentle quip brought a chuckle from the journalists and put Urquhart firmly in control.</p>
<p>‘I have read with considerable surprise and obvious interest this morning’s edition of the Telegraph.’ He held it</p>
<p>up again so that the cameras could get a clear shot. ‘I am</p>
<p>honoured that such a significant and authoritative newspaper should hold a high opinion of my personal capabilities — one which goes far beyond my own judgement of the matter. As you know, I had made it clear that I had no</p>
<p>intention of standing, that I thought it was in the Party’s best interest that the Chief Whip should stand above this particular contest.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Generally that is still my view.</p>
<p>However, the Telegraph raises some important points which should be considered carefully. You will forgive me</p>
<p>if I don’t come to an instant or snap judgement out here on the pavement. I want to spend a little time consulting with</p>
<p>a few colleagues to obtain their opinions, and also to have a long and serious discussion with my wife, whose views</p>
<p>will be most important of all. I shall then sleep upon it, and let you all know tomorrow what decision I have reached. In</p>
<p>the meantime, I hope you will allow me and my family a few hours of peace to think about things. I shall have nothing more to say until tomorrow.’</p>
<p>With one final wave of his hand, still clutching the newspaper and held for many seconds to satisfy the screaming photographers, Urquhart withdrew into his house and shut the door firmly.</p>
<p>By Monday evening, Mattie was beginning to wonder</p>
<p>whether she had been too hasty. After storming out of</p>
<p>Preston’s office she had persuaded herself that she had</p>
<p>resolved all her personal and professional problems in one</p>
<p>grand gesture - no more Krajewski, certainly no more</p>
<p>Preston, just the story to concentrate on. Yet now she was</p>
<p>not so sure. She had spent a lonely weekend identifying the</p>
<p>newspapers for which she would like to work, but as she did so she quickly realised that none of them had any obvious gaps in their political reporting teams which she could hope to fill. The newspaper world is highly competitive, and although she could offer youthful energy and talent in abundance, she had just thrown away the track record of experience on which most editors hire their staff.</p>
<p>She had made many telephone calls but they had led to few appointments; she began to discover that somebody was spreading a story that she had stormed out in tears when Preston had questioned her judgement, and sensitive feminine outbursts do not generally commend themselves to the heavily male-dominated club of newspaper editors.</p>
<p>It did not help her mood that the Bank of England had pushed up interest rates sharply to protect sterling from speculators while a new Prime Minister was selected, leading the building societies that morning to threaten a rise in the mortgage rate. It made her realise that she would have no apparent means of paying for it. It was difficult enough with a salary. Without one, her affairs could very soon become impossible.</p>
