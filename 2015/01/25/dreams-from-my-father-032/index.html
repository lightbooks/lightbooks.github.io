          <p>The continuing struggle to align word and action, our heartfelt desires with a workable plan-didn’t self-esteem finally depend on just this? It was that belief which had led me into organizing, and it was that belief which would lead me to conclude, perhaps for the final time, that notions of purity-of race or of culture-could no more serve as the basis for the typical black American’s self-esteem than it could for mine. Our sense of wholeness would have to arise from something more fine than the bloodlines we’d inherited. It would have to find root in Mrs. Crenshaw’s story and Mr. Marshall’s story, in Ruby’s story and Rafiq’s; in all the messy, contradictory details of our experience.</p>
<p>I went away for two weeks to visit my family. When I returned, I called Ruby and told her I needed her to come to a meeting that Saturday night.</p>
<p>A long pause. “What about?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see. Be ready by six…we’ll grab a bite to eat first.”</p>
<p>Our destination was a full hour away from Ruby’s apartment, in one of the north-side neighborhoods where jazz and</p>
<p>blues had migrated in search of a paying audience. We found a Vietnamese restaurant, and over a plate of noodles and shrimp we talked about her boss at work, the problems she was having with her back. The conversation seemed forced, though, without pause or reflection; as we spoke, we kept skirting each other’s gaze.</p>
<p>By the time we’d paid the restaurant bill and walked next door, the theater was already full. An usher showed us to our seats, which turned out to be in front of a group of black teenage girls out on a field trip. Some of the girls diligently thumbed through their programs, taking their cue from the older woman-a teacher, I assumed-who sat beside them. Most of the girls, though, were too excited to sit still; they whispered and giggled about the play’s lengthy title and asked questions of their chaperone, who showed an admirable patience throughout.</p>
<p>The room was suddenly blanketed in darkness, and the girls fell quiet. Then the lights rose, a dim blue now, and seven black women appeared on the stage dressed in flowing skirts and scarves, their bodies frozen in awkward contortions. One of them, a big woman dressed in brown, began to cry out:</p>
<p>…half-notes scattered</p>
<p>without rhythm / no tune distraught laughter fallin’</p>
<p>over a black girl’s shoulder</p>
<p>it’s funny / it’s hysterical</p>
<p>the melody-less-ness of her dance</p>
<p>don’t tell a soul</p>
<p>she’s dancing on beer cans and shingles…</p>
<p>As she spoke, the other women slowly came to life, a chorus of many shades and shapes, mahogany and cream, round and slender, young and not so young, stretching their limbs across the stage.</p>
<p>somebody / anybody sing a black girl’s song bring her out</p>
<p>to know herself</p>
<p>to know you</p>
<p>but sing her rhythms</p>
<p>carin’ / struggle / hard times sing her song of life…</p>
<p>For the next hour, the women took turns telling their stories, singing their songs. They sang about lost time and discarded fantasies and what might have been. They sang of the men who loved them, betrayed them, raped them, embraced them; they sang of the hurt inside these men, hurt that was understood and sometimes forgiven. They showed each other their stretch marks and the calluses on their feet; they revealed their beauty in the lilt of their voice, the flutter of a hand, beauty waning, ascendant, elusive. They wept over the aborted children, the murdered children, the children they once were. And through all of their songs, violent, angry, sweet, unflinching, the women danced, each of them, double-dutch and rhumba and bump and solitary waltz; sweat-breaking, heart-breaking dances. They danced until they all seemed one spirit. At the end of the play, that spirit began to sing a single, simple verse:</p>
<p>I found god in myself</p>
<p>and I loved her / I loved her fiercely</p>
<p>Lights came up; bows were taken; the girls behind us cheered wildly. I helped Ruby with her coat and we walked out to the parking lot. The temperature had dropped; the stars glinted like ice against the black sky. As we waited for the car to warm up, Ruby leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Her eyes, deep brown, were shimmering. I grabbed her gloved hand and gave it a quick squeeze before starting to drive. Nothing more was said; for the entire ride back to the South Side, until I left her at her door and wished her good-night, we never broke that precious silence.</p>
<p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
<p>I PULLED INTO THE AIRPORT parking lot at a quarter past three and ran to the terminal as fast as I could. Panting for breath, I spun around several times, my eyes scanning the crowds of Indians, Germans, Poles, Thais, and Czechs gathering their luggage.</p>
<p>Damn! I knew I should have left earlier. Maybe she had gotten worried and tried to call. Had I given her my office number? What if she’d missed her flight? What if she had walked right past me and I hadn’t even known it?</p>
<p>I looked down at the photograph in my hand, the one she had sent me two months earlier, smudged now from too much handling. Then I looked up, and the picture came to life: an African woman emerging from behind the customs gate, moving with easy, graceful steps, her bright, searching eyes now fixed on my own, her dark, round, sculpted face blossoming like a wood rose as she smiled.</p>
<p>“Barack?”</p>
<p>“Auma?”</p>
<p>“Oh my…”</p>
<p>I lifted my sister off the ground as we embraced, and we laughed and laughed as we looked at each other. I picked up</p>
<p>her bag and we began to walk to the parking garage, and she slipped her arm through mine. And I knew at that moment, somehow, that I loved her, so naturally, so easily and fiercely, that later, after she was gone, I would find myself mistrusting that love, trying to explain it to myself. Even now I can’t explain it; I only know that the love was true, and still is, and I’m grateful for it.</p>
<p>“So, brother,” Auma said as we drove into the city, “you have to tell me everything.” “About what?”</p>
<p>“Your life, of course.”</p>
<p>“From the beginning?”</p>
<p>“Start anywhere.”</p>
<p>I told her about Chicago and New York, my work as an organizer, my mother and grandparents and Maya-she had heard so much about them from our father, she said, she felt as if she already knew them. She described Heidelberg, where she was trying to finish a master’s degree in linguistics, and the trials and tribulations of living in Germany.</p>
<p>“I have no right to complain, I suppose,” she said. “I have a scholarship, a flat. I don’t know what I would be doing if I was still in Kenya. Still, I don’t care for Germany so much. You know, the Germans like to think of themselves as very liberal when it comes to Africans, but if you scratch the surface you see they still have the attitudes of their childhood. In German fairy tales, black people are always the goblins. Such things one doesn’t forget so easily. Sometimes I try to imagine what it must have been like for the Old Man, leaving home for the first time. Whether he felt that same loneliness…”</p>
<p>The Old Man. That’s what Auma called our father. It sounded right to me, somehow, at once familiar and distant, an elemental force that isn’t fully understood. In my apartment, Auma held up the picture of him that sat on my bookshelf, a studio portrait that my mother had saved.</p>
<p>“He looks so innocent, doesn’t he? So young.” She held the picture next to my face. “You have the same mouth.” I told her she should lie down and get some rest while I went to my office for a few hours of work.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I’m not tired. Let me go with you.”</p>
<p>“You’ll feel better if you take a nap.”</p>
<p>She said, “Agh, Barack! I see you’re bossy like the Old Man as well. And you only met him once? It must be in the</p>
<p>blood.”</p>
<p>I laughed, but she didn’t; instead, her eyes wandered over my face as if it were a puzzle to solve, another piece to a</p>
<p>problem that, beneath the exuberant chatter, nagged at her heart.</p>
<p>I gave her a tour of the South Side that afternoon, the same drive I had taken in my first days in Chicago, only with</p>
<p>some of my own memories now. When we stopped by my office, Angela, Mona, and Shirley happened to be there. They asked Auma all about Kenya and how she braided her hair and how come she talked so pretty, like the queen of England, and the four of them enjoyed themselves thoroughly talking about me and all my strange habits.</p>
<p>“They seem very fond of you,” Auma said afterward. “They remind me of our aunties back home.” She rolled down the window and stuck her face into the wind, watching Michigan Avenue pass by: the gutted remains of the old Roseland Theatre, a garage full of rusted cars. “Are you doing this for them, Barack?” she asked, turning back to me. “This organizing business, I mean?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “For them. For me.”</p>
<p>That same expression of puzzlement, and fear, returned to Auma’s face. “I don’t like politics much,” she said. “Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. People always end up disappointed.”</p>
<p>There was a letter waiting for her in my mailbox when we got home; it was from a German law student she said she’d</p>
<p>been seeing. The letter was voluminous, at least seven pages long, and as I prepared dinner, she sat at the kitchen table and laughed and sighed and clicked her tongue, her face suddenly soft and wistful.</p>
<p>“I thought you didn’t like Germans,” I said.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes and laughed. “Yah-Otto is different. He’s so sweet! And sometimes I treat him so badly! I don’t know, Barack. Sometimes I think it’s just impossible for me to trust anybody completely. I think of what the Old Man made of his life, and the idea of marriage gives me, how do you say…the shivers. Also, with Otto and his career, we would have to live in Germany, you see. I start imagining what it would be like for me, living my entire life as a foreigner, and I don’t think I could take it.”</p>
<p>She folded her letter and put it back in the envelope. “What about you, Barack?” she asked. “Do you have these problems, or is it just your sister who’s so confused?”</p>
<p>“I think I know what you’re feeling.”</p>
<p>“Tell me.”</p>
<p>I went to the refrigerator and pulled out two green peppers, setting them on the cutting board. “Well…there was a</p>
<p>woman in New York that I loved. She was white. She had dark hair, and specks of green in her eyes. Her voice sounded like a wind chime. We saw each other for almost a year. On the weekends, mostly. Sometimes in her apartment, sometimes in mine. You know how you can fall into your own private world? Just two people, hidden and warm. Your own language. Your own customs. That’s how it was.</p>
<p>“Anyway, one weekend she invited me to her family’s country house. The parents were there, and they were very nice, very gracious. It was autumn, beautiful, with woods all around us, and we paddled a canoe across this round, icy lake full of small gold leaves that collected along the shore. The family knew every inch of the land. They knew how the hills had formed, how the glacial drifts had created the lake, the names of the earliest white settlers-their ancestors- and before that, the names of the Indians who’d once hunted the land. The house was very old, her grandfather’s house. He had inherited it from his grandfather. The library was filled with old books and pictures of the grandfather with famous people he had known-presidents, diplomats, industrialists. There was this tremendous gravity to the room. Standing in that room, I realized that our two worlds, my friend’s and mine, were as distant from each other as Kenya is from Germany. And I knew that if we stayed together I’d eventually live in hers. After all, I’d been doing it most of my life. Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.”</p>
