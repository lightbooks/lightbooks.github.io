          <p>Road and the Union Bank of Turkey, where I opened up an account in the same fictional name - not with £50,000 but with just £100. The whole thing took-less than three hours from start to finish. So I can now start ordering pornographic magazines, paid for out of the newbank account and delivered to the Paddington address, which could do a lot of damage to the reputation of one completely innocent politician’</p>
<p>‘Er, who?’ asked Preston, still having difficulty catching up.</p>
<p>She laughed and threw down a bank book and the tobacconist’s receipt onto the editor’s desk. He looked at them eagerly.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition!’ he shouted in alarm. ‘What the hell have you done?’</p>
<p>‘Nothing,’ she said with a smile suggesting victory. ‘Except to show that Charles Collingridge was almost certainly framed; that he probably never went near the tobacconist shop or the Union Bank of Turkey, and therefore that he could not have bought those shares’</p>
<p>Preston was holding the documents at arm’s length as if they might catch fire.</p>
<p>‘Which means that Henry Collingridge did not tell his brother about Renox Chemicals…’ Her inflexion indicated that there was more. ‘And? And?’ Preston demanded.</p>
<p>‘He didn’t have to resign.’</p>
<p>Preston sagged back in his chair. The beads of perspiration had begun to trickle down his brow, plastering his hair to his forehead. He was looking exceedingly uncomfortable. He felt as if he were being torn in two. With one eye he could see the makings of a superb story, which, when promoted vigorously by his advertising agency, could bring with it the substantial boost in circulation he was finding so elusive. Whether the story was accurate or not hardly bothered him; the lawyers could ensure that it libelled no one and it would make a splendid read.</p>
<p>With his other eye, however, he could discern the enormous impact that such a story would make on the leadership race itself, the uncontrollable shockwaves which would stretch out and swamp various innocent bystanders-possibly including himself. And Landless had just told him on the telephone that he had other fish to fry. He brushed back the lick of hair which was stuck clammily above his glasses, but it did not seem to help his vision. He could not focus on which decision would be the right one to take, the one which would be acceptable to Landless. He had been instructed that all major pieces affecting the leadership race were to be cleared with Landless before publication, and he had feared being confronted with an unexpected decision like this. He needed to play for time.</p>
<p>‘Mattie, I scarcely know what to say. You’ve obviously been very … busy.’ His mind was charging through his Thesaurus of flannel, words which were meaningless and noncommittal but which left their audience with an appropriately warm feeling of encouragement. It was a well thumbed volume. But then it hit him, and the book closed shut with a snap.</p>
<p>‘You’ve illustrated very well that it might have been someone else who was charging round London opening accounts in Collingridge’s name, but you haven’t proved that it wasn’t Collingridge himself. Surely that is the easiest explanation to accept?’</p>
<p>‘But the computer file, Grev. It was tampered with. And that wouldn’t have happened if Charles Collingridge were guilty.’</p>
<p>Haven’t you considered the possibility that the computer file was altered, not to mcrirninate Collingridge, but by Collingridge or one of his friends to offer him an alibi, to muddy the waters after he had been found out? For all we know it was not the distribution file but the accounts file which was altered, possibly only minutes before you saw it, just to throw you off the trail’</p>
<p>‘But only a handful of people have access to the accounts file’ Mattie protested with considerable vigour. ‘And how could Charles Collingridge have done that? He’s been drying out in a treatment centre.’ ‘But his brother?’</p>
<p>Mattie was incredulous. You can’t seriously believe that the Prime Minister took the incredible risk of ordering the party headquarters’ computer file to be altered just to falsify the evidence - after he had already announced his resignation.’</p>
<p>‘Mattie, think back. Watergate. Files were burnt and tapes erased - by the President. During Irangate, incriminating material was shredded and smuggled out of the White House by a secretary in her underwear. Scores of presidential aides and US Cabinet ministers have gone to prison in recent years. And in this country, Jeremy Thorpe was put on trial for attempted murder, John Stonehouse went to gaol after faking his own suicide and Lloyd George sold peerages from Downing Street while he screwed his secretary on the Cabinet table. Things much stranger than fiction have happened in politics.’ Preston was warming to his theme now. ‘Power is a drug, like a candle to a moth. They are drawn towards it, no matter what the dangers, They would rather risk everything, including their lives and careers, than do without it. So it’s still easier to believe that the Collingridges got caught with their hands in the till and are trying to cover up than to accept there was a great conspiracy against the Prime Minister.’</p>
<p>‘So you won’t run it!’ she accused sharply.</p>
<p>‘No, I’m not saying that’ Preston continued, smiling in a manner which betrayed not a shred of sympathy. I’m saying you haven’t yet got enough for the story to stand up. We have to be careful not to make ourselves look ridiculous. You need to do some more work on it.’</p>
<p>He meant it as a dismissal, but Mattie had been at the receiving end of too many of his dismissals. She had spent every waking hour since running out on Johnnie working on this story, chasing the details and trying to drown her private pain, knowing that only by uncovering the truth would she find any release from the emotions which were twisted in a state of perpetual warfare deep inside her. She would not leave it there. She felt like screaming at him, but she was determined not to lose her self-control. She took a deep breath, lowered her eyes for a moment to help herself relax, and was almost smiling when she looked at him once again.</p>
<p>‘Grev. Just explain it to me so I can understand. Either somebody set the Collingridges up, or the Prime Minister of this country has established his guilt by falsifying evidence. One way or the other, we have enough to lead the paper for a week.’</p>
<p>‘Er, yes. But which is it? We have to be sure. Particularly in the middle of a leadership contest we cannot afford to make a mistake on something so important.’</p>
<p>‘Doesn’t Collingridge deserve the chance to establish his innocence? Are you telling me that the story has to be left until after the contest has finished—until after the damage has been done?’</p>
<p>Preston had run out of logic. Once again he was discovering that this inexperienced woman, one of his most junior members of staff, was slipping every argument he could throw at her. As she suspected he would, he sought refuge in bluster and bullying.</p>
<p>‘Look!’ he snapped, pointing an accusatory finger in her direction. You burst into my office with a story so fantastic, demanding that I scrap the front page for it… But you haven’t written any copy yet! How the devil can I tell whether you’ve got a good story or simply had a good lunch?’</p>
<p>Her blue eyes glinted like polar ice, her mind tumbling with the many slights she wanted to throw back at him. Instead, a frosty calm settled over her.</p>
<p>‘You will have your copy in thirty minutes,’ she said as she walked out, barely able to resist the temptation to slam the door off its hinges.</p>
<p>It was actually nearer forty minutes when she walked back in, without knocking, six pages of double-spaced copy clutched in her hand. Without comment she dropped them on the desk, standing directly in front of Preston to make it clear that she would not budge until she had her answer.</p>
<p>He left her standing while slowly he read through the pages, trying to look as if he were struggling with an important decision. But it was a sham. The decision had already been made just a few minutes after Mattie had left his office and seconds after he had managed to reach the newspaper’s owner on the phone.</p>
<p>‘She’s determined, Mr Landless. She knows she’s got the makings of a good story and she won’t take no for an answer. What the hell do I do?’ ‘Persuade her she’s wrong. Put her on the cookery page. Send her on holiday. Promote her to editor, for all I care. But keep her quiet!’</p>
<p>It’s not that simple. She’s not only stubborn as hell, she’s one of the best political brains we’ve got.’</p>
<p>‘Preston, you already have the best political brains in the business. Mine! All I am asking you to do is to control your staff. Are you telling me you can’t do even that?’ Landless asked in a tone full of menace. ‘There are scarcely two weeks before the leadership race is over,’ he continued. There are great things at stake, the whole future of the country, my business - your job. Do whatever you have to do to keep her quiet. Just don’t screw up!’</p>
<p>The proprietor’s words were still ringing in Preston’s ears as he continued to shuffle the pieces of paper, no longer reading them, concentrating instead on what he was about to say. Normally he enjoyed his power as editorial executioner, but he knew she would never fit the typecast role of whimpering victim. He was unsure how he should handle her.</p>
<p>Finally he put Mattie’s story down, and pushed himself back into his chair. He felt more comfortable with the support of the chair behind his back. ‘We can’t run it. It’s too risky, and I’m not willing to blow the leadership contest apart on the basis of speculation.’</p>
<p>It was what she had expected all along. She replied in a whisper, but her soft words hit Preston like a boxing glove.</p>
<p>￼‘I will not take no for an answer’</p>
<p>Dammit. Why didn’t she just accept it, shrug it off or just burst into tears like the others? The quiet insolence behind her words and his inability to handle it made him feel nervous. He started to sweat; he knew that she had noticed this sign of tension, and he began to stumble over his carefully prepared words.</p>
<p>‘I… cannot run the story. I am the editor, and that’s my decision.’ He wasn’t even convincing himself. You have to accept it, or.. ‘</p>
<p>‘Or what,Grev?’</p>
<p>‘… or realise that you have no future on our political staff.’</p>
<p>‘You’re firing me?’ This did surprise her. How could he afford to let her go, particularly in the middle of the leadership contest?</p>
<p>‘No. I’m moving you to women’s features, starting right now. Frankly, I don’t think you have developed the judgement for our political columns.’ ‘Who has nobbled you, Grev?’</p>
<p>‘What the hell do you mean… ?’</p>
<p>You normally have trouble making up your mind whether you want tea or coffee. Deciding to fire me from this story is somebody else’s decision, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>I’m not firing you! You’re being transferred…’</p>
<p>He was losing control now, eyes bulging in anger and with a complexion which looked as if he had been holding his bream for three minutes. Then, dear editor, I have some disappointing news for you. I quit!’</p>
<p>God, he hadn’t expected this. He was scrambling now to regain his authority and the initiative. He had to keep her at the Telegraph, it was the only way to control her. But what the hell was he to do? He forced a smile, and spread his hands wide in an attempt to imitate a gesture of generosity.</p>
