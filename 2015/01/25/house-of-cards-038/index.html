          <p>‘Don’t worry, Pen. I’ll deal with it.’ He fell back on the swaggering confidence of years of salesmanship, of persuading people to buy ideas and arguments, not because they were all particularly good but because his audiences found themselves captivated by his energy and enthusiasm. In a world full of cynicism, they wanted to put their trust in a man who seemed to believe so passionately in what he was offering.</p>
<p>When Mattie arrived in his office after lunch, he was bright, alert, those strange eyes of his still amazingly animated but seeming very anxious to help.</p>
<p>‘Just a stomach upset’ he explained. ‘Sorry I had to stand you up.’</p>
<p>Mattie acknowledged that his smile was full of charm; it was difficult not to want to believe him. ‘I understand you were asking about Mr Collingridge’s accommodation address?’</p>
<p>￼’Sounds as if you are admitting that it was Charles Collingridge’s address?’ she enquired.</p>
<p>‘Well, if you want something on the record, you know I have to say that Mr Collingridge’s personal affairs are his own, and no one here is going to comment one way or the other on any speculation.’ He trotted out the Downing Street line with accomplished ease. ‘But may I talk to you off the record, not for reporting?’</p>
<p>He made strong eye contact with her as if to establish his sincerity, rising from behind his desk to come and sit alongside Mattie in one of the informal chairs which littered his office.</p>
<p>‘Even off the record, Mattie, there’s a limit to how much I can say, but you know how unwell Charles has been. He’s not been fully responsible for his actions, and it would be a terrible pity if we were to go out of our way to punish him still further. His life is in ruins. Whatever he has done wrong, hasn’t he suffered enough already?’</p>
<p>Mattie felt angry as she watched the loading of guilt onto the shoulders of the absent Charles. The whole world is to blame, Roger, except for you. ‘Are you denying that Charles Collingridge himself asked you to open that address?’</p>
<p>‘So long as this is not for reporting but for your background information, I’m not going to deny it, but what good will it do anyone to re-open such old wounds? Give him a chance to rebuild his life’ he pleaded.</p>
<p>‘OK, Roger. I see no point in trying to subject him to farther harassment. So let me turn to a different point. There have been lots of accusations about how party headquarters has been very careless in allowing damaging ma-, terial to leak out in recent months. The Prime Minister issupposed to blame Smith Square very directly for much of his troubles’</p>
<p>‘I doubt whether that is fair, but it is no secret that relations between him and the Party Chairman have been very strained’</p>
<p>‘Strained enough for that opinion poll we published during party conference week to have been leaked deliberately from party headquarters?’ Mattie had to look very hard to detect the faint glimmer of surprise behind his flashing eyes before he sped into his explanation.</p>
<p>‘I think that assumption is very difficult to justify. There are only - what, five people in this building who are circulated with copies of that material apart from the Party Chairman. I’m one of those five, and I can tell you how seriously we take the confidentiality of such material.’ He lit a Gauloise. Time to think. ‘But it also gets sent to every Cabinet Minister, all twenty-two of them, either at the House of Commons where it would be opened by one of those gossipy secretaries, or to their Departments where it would be opened by a civil servant, many of whom have no love for this Government. Any leak is much more likely to have come from there.’</p>
<p>‘But the papers were leaked at the headquarters hotel in Bournemouth. House of Commons secretaries or unfriendly civil servants don’t go to the party conference or roam around the headquarters hotel’</p>
<p>‘Who knows, Mattie. It’s still much more likely to have come from a source like that. Can you imagine Lord Williams scurrying around on his hands and knees outside hotel room doors?’</p>
<p>He laughed loudly to show how ridiculous it was, and Mattie joined in, realising that O’Neill had just admitted he knew the manner in which the opinion poll had been handed over, and he could only have known that for one reason. His overconfidence was tightening the noose around his neck even as he laughed.</p>
<p>‘Let me turn to another leak then, on the hospital expansion scheme. Now I am told that party headquarters was planning a major publicity drive during last summer, which had to be scrapped because of the change of plan’</p>
<p>‘Really? Who on earth told you that?’ asked O’Neill, knowing full well that it could only have been Kendrick, probably egged on by his weakness for a pretty woman. ‘Never mind, I know you won’t reveal your sources. But they sound exaggerated to me. The Publicity Department here is always ready to sell Government policy, and had the scheme gone ahead then certainly we would have wanted to help promote it, but we had no specific campaign in mind.’</p>
<p>‘I was told you had to scrap a campaign which had been carefully planned and which was ready to go.’</p>
<p>The limp ash from his cigarette gave up its struggle to defy the laws of gravity and cascaded like an avalanche down his tie, but O’Neill ignored it. He was concentrating hard now.</p>
<p>‘You’ve been misinformed. Sounds to me like someone wanting to dig up the story again and trying to show the Party in much greater confusion than it actually was. Your source sounds a bit dubious to me. Are you sure he’s in a position to know all the facts, or has he got his own angle to sell?’</p>
<p>With a broad grin, O’Neill tried to smother Kendrick as a reliable source, and the smile which Mattie returned betrayed none of her own wonderment at his impromptu yet superbly crafted explanations. But she was asking far too many leading questions, and even a polished performer such as O’Neill was beginning to feel distinctly uncomfortable. He felt a gut-wrenching need for greater stimulation and support than his Gauloise could give him, no matter what Urquhart had said.</p>
<p>‘Mattie, I’m afraid I’ve got a busy day, and I have to make sure we are ready to handle the result of the ballot later this evening. Could we finish it here?’</p>
<p>￼Thanks for your time, Roger. I have found it immensely helpful in clearing up a few things.’</p>
<p>￼’Any time I can help,’ he said as he guided her towards the door. As they did so, they passed by the computer terminal stationed in the corner of his crowded office. She bent down to inspect it more closely.</p>
<p>I’m an absolute moron with these things,’ she commented, turning to look straight into his flickering eyes. I’m impressed to see your Party is well ahead of the others in using new technology. Are all the terminals in this building linked through the central computer?’</p>
<p>‘I… believe so,’ he said, pressing her more firmly towards the door.</p>
<p>‘I never knew you had such high-tech skills, Roger,’ she complimented.</p>
<p>‘Oh, I don’t,’ he said in a surprisingly defensive mood. ‘We all get put through a training course, but I’m not even sure how to switch the wretched things on, actually. Never use it myself.’ His smile had tightened, and his eyes were flickering ever more violently. He propelled Mattie through the door with some force, and bade her a hasty farewell.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. the doors to the Commons Committee Room were ceremoniously shut to bar any further attempts to lodge votes in the leadership election. The gesture was an empty one, because the last of the 335 votes had been cast ten minutes earlier. Behind the doors gathered Sir Humphrey and his small team of scrutineers, happy that the day had gone smoothly in spite of the appalling start given to their preparations by Earle. A bottle of whisky did the rounds while they fortified themselves for the count. In different rooms around the Palace of Westminster, the candidates waited in various states of excitement for the summons which would tell them that the counting had finished and the result was ready to be announced.</p>
<p>Big Ben had struck the quarter after six before the eight candidates received the call, and at half past the hour more than 120 active supporters and interested MPs accompanied them as the Committee Room doors swung open to allow them back in. There was much good humour mixed with the tension as they filed in and stood around in loose groups, with substantial sums being wagered as Members made last-minute calculations as to the likely result and gambled their judgement against the inconclusive opinion polls which had been filling the press. Outside the room, excluded from what was technically a private party meeting, the men from the media did their own speculating and made their own odds.</p>
<p>Sir Humphrey was enjoying his little moment of history. He was in the twilight of his career, long since past his parliamentary heyday, and even the little misunderstanding over his holiday in the West Indies had helped bring him greater recognition and attention around the Westminster circuit than he had enjoyed for many years. Who knows, if he handled this correctly, his secret longing for a seat in the House of Lords might yet be fulfilled. He sat on the raised dais of the Committee Room, flanked by his lieutenants, and called the meeting to order.</p>
<p>‘Since there has been such an unprecedentedly large number of names on the ballot paper, I propose to read the results out in alphabetical order’</p>
<p>This was unwelcome news for David Adams, the former Leader of the House who had been banished to discontented exile on the backbenches by Coilingridge’s first reshuffle. Having spent the last two years criticising all the major economic decisions which he had supported whilst in Government, he had hoped for a good showing in order to establish his claim for a return to Cabinet. He stood there stoically, hiding his grief as Newlands announced he had received only twelve votes. He was left to wonder what had happened to all those firm promises of support he had received while Sir Humphrey continued with his roll call. None of the next four names, including McKenzie’s, could muster the support of more than twenty of their colleagues with Paul Goddard, the maverick Catholic who had stood on the single issue of banning all forms of legalised abortion, receiving only three. He shook his head defiantly; his rewards were not to be of the earthly kind.</p>
<p>Sir Humphrey had only three more names to announce - Samuel, Urquhart and Woolton - and a total of 281 votes to distribute. The level of tension soared as those present recalled that a minimum of 169 votes was required for success on the first ballot. A couple of huge side bets were instantly concluded in one comer as two Honourable Members wagered that there would, after all, be a result on the first round.</p>
<p>The Right Honourable Michael Samuel’ intoned the chairman, ‘99 votes’</p>
<p>In the dead silence of the Committee Room, the sound of a tug blowing its klaxon three times as it passed on its way up the Thames could be clearly heard. A ripple of amusement covered the tension, and Samuel muttered that it was a pity tug masters didn’t have a vote. He was clearly disappointed to be such a long way from the necessary winning total, particularly after Earle’s withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Right Honourable Francis Urquhart - 91 votes.’</p>
<p>Two of the gamblers in the comer looked crestfallen as they calculated the final figure.</p>
