          <p>Somewhat donnishly Spence explained the foibles of opinion polling, the margin of error you should always remember, the rogue polls which in spite of all the pollsters’ efforts still sneaked through and simply got it wrong. like the one I’ve just seen’ Mattie remarked with a twinge, still tender from her earlier embarrassment,</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’ Spence enquired sharply.</p>
<p>Mattie looked at him and saw that the affable official had now developed a flush which even as she looked was spreading from the collar up to the</p>
<p>￼eyes. The eyes themselves had lost their eagerness. Spence was not a trained politician and was not adept at hiding his feelings, and the confusion was flowing through. Why was he so flustered? Mattie mentally kicked herself. Surely the damned figures couldn’t be right after all? The dynamic young reporter of the year had already jumped several somersaults that morning, and feeling rather sour with herself decided that one more leap could scarcely dent her professional pride any further.</p>
<p>‘I understand, Kevin, that your latest figures are quite disappointing. In fact, somebody mentioned a figure of 31 per cent.’</p>
<p>Spence, whose cheeks had been getting even redder as Mattie spoke, reached for his tea to give himself time to think, but his hand was trembling.</p>
<p>‘And the PM personally is down to 24 per cent’ she ventured. ‘I can’t remember any Prime Minister being as unpopular as that.’</p>
<p>At this point the tea began to spill from the cup, and Spence returned it quickly to the saucer.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what you’re talking about’ he muttered, addressing the napkin which he was using to mop up the tea.</p>
<p>‘Aren’t these your latest figures?’ Mattie reached once more inside her bag and pulled out the mysterious sheet of paper which she proceeded to smooth on the table cloth. As she did so, she noticed for the first time .the initials KJS typed along the bottom.</p>
<p>Spence reached out and tried to push the paper away from him, seemingly afraid to get too near to it ‘Where on earth did you get that?’ He looked around desperately to see whether anyone had noticed the exchange.</p>
<p>Mattie picked up the piece of paper and began reading it out loud.’ “Opinion Research Survey Number 40” - this is yours, isn’t it?’ Yes, but… Please, Miss Storin!’</p>
<p>He was not used to dissembling. Spence was clearly deeply upset, and seeing no way of escape decided to throw himself on the mercy of his breakfast companion. In a hushed voice, and still looking nervously around the room, he pleaded with her.</p>
<p>I’m not supposed to talk to you about any opinion research. It’s strictly confidential.’</p>
<p>‘But Kevin, it’s only one piece of paper.’</p>
<p>You don’t know what it’s like. If these figures get out, and I’m the one thought to have given them to you, I’d be out on my ear. Everyone’s looking for scapegoats. There are so many rumours flooding around. The PM doesn’t trust the Chairman. The Chairman doesn’t trust us. Everybody says that heads are going to roll. I like my job, Miss Storin. I can’t afford to be blamed for leaking confidential figures to you.’</p>
<p>‘I didn’t realise morale was so bad.’</p>
<p>Spence looked utterly miserable. I’ve never known it worse. Everyone was exhausted after the election, and there was a lot of bad feeling flying around because the result wasn’t as good as we expected. Then all those leaks and reports that the Cabinet were at each other’s throats, so instead of a long break during the summer Lord Williams kept us all hard at it. Frankly, all most of us are trying to do is to keep our heads down so that when it hits the fan we get as little of it as possible.’</p>
<p>He looked at Mattie eye-to-eye for the first time. ‘Please don’t drag me into this.’</p>
<p>‘Kevin, you did not leak this report to me and I shall confirm that to anyone who wants to know. But if I’m to help you I shall need a little help myself. This is your latest polling report, right?’</p>
<p>She slipped the paper back across the table. Spence took another anguished look at it and nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p>They are prepared, by you and circulated on a tightly restricted basis?’ Another nod.</p>
<p>‘All I need to know from you, Kevin, is who gets them. That can’t be a state secret, can it?’</p>
<p>There was no more fight left in Spence. He seemed to hold his breath for a long time before replying.</p>
<p>‘Numbered copies are circulated in double-sealed envelopes solely to Cabinet Ministers and five senior headquarters personnel: the Deputy Chairman and four senior directors.’</p>
<p>He tried to moisten his mouth with another drink of tea, but discovered he had already spilt most of it. How on earth did you get hold of it?’</p>
<p>‘Let’s just say someone got a little careless, shall we?’</p>
<p>‘Not my office?’ he gasped, his insecurity flooding out.</p>
<p>‘No, Kevin. You’ve just given me the names of over two dozen people who receive the figures, and with their secretaries it would bring the possible number of sources to well over fifty.’ She gave him one of her most reassuring, warm smiles. Don’t worry, I won’t involve you. But let’s keep in touch.’</p>
<p>Mattie left the breakfast room. She should have been feeling elated about the front page story she was now able to write but she was wondering too hard how the devil she was ever going to identify the turncoat.</p>
<p>￼Room 561 in the hotel could not be described as five star. It was one of the smallest rooms, far away from the main entrance and at the end of the top floor corridor under the eaves. The party hierarchy did not stay here, it was definitely a room for the workers.</p>
<p>Penny Guy hadn’t heard the steps outside in the corridor before the door burst open. She sat bolt upright in bed, startled and exposing two perfectly formed breasts.</p>
<p>‘Shit, Roger, don’t you ever bloody knock?’ She threw a pillow at the intruder. ‘And what the hell are you doing up so early? You don’t normally surface until lunchtime.’</p>
<p>She did not bother to cover herself as O’Neill sat down at the end of the bed. There was an ease between them suggesting an absence of any sexual threat which would have startled most people. O’Neill constantly flirted with her, particularly in public, but on the two occasions when Penny had offered, O’Neill had been very affectionate and warm but had complained of being too exhausted. She guessed he had a deep streak of sexual insecurity running through him, which he hid beneath flattery and innuendo. Penny had heard from other women who had spent time with O’Neill that he was frequently too exhausted - attentive, Very forward, suggestive, but rarely able to commit himself fully. She was very fond of him, and longed to ease the insecurities out of him with her long, electric fingers, but she knew he would not drop his guard long enough to let her weave her magic. She had worked for O’Neill for nearly three years and had seen him slowly change as he found the pressures of political and public life increasingly infatuating, yet steadily more difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>To those who did not know him well he was extrovert, amusing, full of charm, ideas and energy. But Penny had watched him become increasingly erratic. He rarely came into the office nowadays before noon,’ he had started making many private phone calls, getting agitated, disappearing suddenly. His constant hay fever and sneezing were unpleasant, but Penny was devoted to him. She did not understand many of the odd ways he had developed -particularly why he would not sleep with her. She had that strange blindness for him which comes with daily familiarity and strong affections. But she knew he depended on her. If he didn’t need her in bed, he needed her practically every other moment of his day. It wasn’t the same as love, but her warm heart responded anyway. She would do</p>
<p>almost anything for him.</p>
<p>‘You got up this early just to come and woo me, didn’t you? You can’t resist me after all,’ she teased.</p>
<p>‘Shut up, you little tart, and cover up those gorgeous tits. That’s not fair.’</p>
<p>Smiling wickedly, she lifted her breasts up towards him, goading him. ‘Can’t resist them after all. Well, who am I to refuse an order from the boss?’</p>
<p>Playfully she threw the bedclothes off her naked body and moved over on the mattress to make room for him. O’Neill’s eyes couldn’t help but follow the line of her long legs, and for the first time since Penny had known him he began to blush. She giggled as she noticed him staring hypnotically at her body, and he made a grab for the bedclothes to try and cover her up but instead succeeded only in losing his balance and getting tangled up in her long brown arms. As he lifted his head off the mattress, he found a rigid dark nipple staring at him from less than three inches away, and he had to use all of his strength to tear himself free. He retreated to the other side of the small room, visibly shaking.</p>
<p>‘Pen, please! You know I’m not at my best this early in the morning.’</p>
<p>‘OK, Roger. Don’t worry. I’m not going to rape you.’ She was laughing playfully as she pulled the sheets loosely around her. ‘But what are you doing up so early?’</p>
<p>I’ve just left this incredibly beautiful Brazilian gymnast who has spent all night teaching me a whole series of new exercises. We didn’t have any gymnastic rings, so we used the chandelier. OK?’</p>
<p>She shook her head firmly.</p>
<p>‘How could one so young and beautiful be so cynical?’ he protested. ‘All right. I had to make a delivery in the vicinity and I thought I’d come and say good morning.’</p>
<p>He didn’t bother to add that Mattie Storin had nearly caught him as he was placing the document amongst the newspapers, and he welcomed the chance to lie low in his secretary’s room for a while. He was still elated at the trouble which the leaked poll would cause the Party Chairman, who had been openly hostile to him in the last few weeks. Through his paranoia, worked on by Urquhart, he had failed to notice that the hard-pressed Williams had been short with most of his colleagues as well.</p>
<p>Penny tried to bring him back down to earth. ‘Yeah, but next time you come to say good morning, try knocking first. And make it after 8.30’ ‘Don’t give me a hard time. You know I can’t live without you.’</p>
<p>‘Enough passion, Roger. What do you want? You have to want something, don’t you, even if not my body?’</p>
<p>‘Actually, I did come to ask you something. It’s a bit delicate really…’</p>
<p>‘Go ahead, Roger. You can be frank. You’ve already seen there’s no one else in the bed!’ She started laughing again.</p>
<p>O’Neill began to recover his salesman’s charms, and started upon the story which Urquhart had drummed into him me previous evening.</p>
<p>‘Pen, you remember Patrick Woolton, the Foreign Secretary. You typed a couple of his speeches during the election, and he certainly remembers you. He asked after you when I saw him last night and I think he’s rather smitten with you. Anyway, he wondered if you would be interested in dinner with him but he didn’t want to upset or offend you by asking direct, so I sort of offered to have a quiet word as it might be easier for you to say no to me rather than to him personally, you see’</p>
<p>￼’OK, Roger’ ‘OK what, Pen?’</p>
<p>‘OK. I’ll have dinner with him. What’s the big deal?’ ‘Nothing. Except… Woolton’s got a bit of a reputation with the ladies. He might just want more than - dinner.’ Hoger, every man I’ve ever been out with since the age of fourteen has always wanted more than dinner. I can handle it. Might be interesting. He could improve my French!’ She burst into fits of giggles once again, and threw her last pillow at him. O’Neill retreated through the door as Penny was looking around for something else to throw.</p>
