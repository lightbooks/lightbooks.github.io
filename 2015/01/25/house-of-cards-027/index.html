          <p>‘OK, Clark Kent. Seems fair enough. Look, I can get a hard copy of the face off the video tape and show it around. We could try old Freddie, one of our staff photographers. Not only does he have an excellent memory for faces, he is also an alcoholic who dried out a couple of years ago. He still goes religiously every week to Alcoholics Anonymous, and he might well be able to put us on the right track. There aren’t that many treatment centres, we should be able to make some progress - but I still don’t accept your conspiracy theory, Mattie. It’s still all much more likely to be circumstance and coincidence.’</p>
<p>You cynical bastard, what do I have to do to convince you?’</p>
<p>‘Come here and show me a little more of that feminine intuition of yours,’ he growled.</p>
<p>At almost exactly the same time in the private booth of a fashionable and overpriced restaurant in the West End of London, Landless and Urquhart were also locked together, in an embrace of an entirely mercenary kind.</p>
<p>Interesting times, Frankie, interesting times,’ mused Landless.</p>
<p>In China, I believe, it is a curse to live in interesting times.’</p>
<p>I’m sure Collingridge agrees!’ said Landless, bursting into gruff laughter.</p>
<p>He tapped the ash off his thick Havana cigar and savoured the large cognac before returning to his guest.</p>
<p>‘Frankie, I invited you here this evening to ask just one question. I shan’t beat around the bush, and I shall thank you to be absolutely blunt with me. Are you going to stand for the leadership?’ He glared directly at Urquhart, trying to intimidate him into total frankness.</p>
<p>‘I can’t tell yet. The situation is very unclear, and I shall have to wait for the dust to settle a little…’</p>
<p>‘OK, Frankie, let me put it this way. Do you want it? Because if you do, old son, I can be very helpful to you.’</p>
<p>Urquhart returned his host’s direct stare, looking deep into the protruding, bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>‘I want it very, very much.’</p>
<p>It was the first time he admitted to anyone other than himself his burning desire to hold the reins of ‘Prime</p>
<p>Ministerial power, yet with Landless, who wore his naked ambition on his sleeve, he felt no embarrassment in the confession.</p>
<p>‘That’s good. Let’s start from there. Let me tell you what the Telegraph will be running tomorrow. It’s an analysis</p>
<p>piece by our political correspondent, Mattie Storin. Pretty blonde girl with long legs and big blue eyes - d’you know her, Frankie?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ mused Urquhart. ‘Only professionally, of course,’</p>
<p>he hastened to add as he saw the fleshy lips of his companion preparing a lewd comment. ‘Bright, too. I’m interested to discover how she sees things.’</p>
<p>‘Says it is an open race for the leadership, that Collingridge’s resignation has come so quickly and unexpectedly that no potential successor has got his public case prepared very well. So almost anything could happen.’</p>
<p>￼‘I believe she is right,’ nodded Urquhart. ‘Which worries me. The whole election process could be over in less than</p>
<p>three weeks, and it’s the slick, flashy television performers who will gain the best start. The tide is eveiything in</p>
<p>winning these contests; if it’s with you, it will sweep you home; flowing against you, then no matter how good a swimmer you are, you’ll still drown’</p>
<p>‘Which slick, flashy television performers in particular?’ Try Michael Samuel’</p>
<p>‘Mmmm, young, impressive, principled, seems intelligent — not at all to my liking. He wants to interfere in</p>
<p>everything, rebuild the world. Got too much of a conscience for my liking, and not enough experience in taking hard, sound decisions.’</p>
<p>‘So what do we do?’ asked Urquhart.</p>
<p>Landless cupped the crystal goblet in his huge hands, swirled the dark liquor and chuckled quietly.</p>
<p>‘Frankie, tides turn. You can be swimming strongly for the shore one minute, and the next be swept out to sea.. ‘</p>
<p>He took a huge gulp of cognac, raised his finger to order another round, and settled his bulk as comfortably as he could into his chair before resuming the conversation.</p>
<p>‘Frankie, this afternoon I instructed a small and extremely confidential team at the Telegraph to start contacting as many of the Government’s Members of Parliament as they can get hold of in the next twenty-four hours to ask which way they are going to vote. In the next</p>
<p>edition of the Telegraph, they will publish the results -which I confidently predict will show Mr Samuel with</p>
<p>a small but clear lead over the rest of the field’</p>
<p>‘What?’ exclaimed Urquhart in horror. ‘How do you know this? The poll hasn’t even been finished yet…’ ‘Frankie, I know what the poll is going to say because I am the publisher of the bloody newspaper’ ‘You mean you’ve fixed it? But why are you pushing Samuel?’</p>
<p>‘Because although the poll will show a very reasonable level of support for you, at the moment you can’t win the</p>
<p>contest. You’re the Chief Whip, you don’t have any great public platform from which to preach, and if it becomes a free-for- all you’re going to get trampled in the rush’</p>
<p>Urquhart had to acknowledge the weakness of his position as the faceless man of Government.</p>
<p>‘So we push Mr Samuel, get him off to a roaring start, which means instead of a free-for-all we have a target at which everyone is going to shoot. In a couple of weeks’ time, he’s going to be amazed at the number of bad friends he’s got within the Party, all trying to do him down. Hell be on the defensive. Fighting the tide.’</p>
<p>Urquhart was astonished at the clarity of the Landless analysis, and began to understand why the East-Ender had become such a striking success in the business world.</p>
<p>‘So where do I come into this great plan?’</p>
<p>‘You’ve got to develop a unique selling proposition for yourself, something which will be attractive to your fellow MPs and set you apart from your rivals.’</p>
<p>‘Such as?’ asked the bewildered Urquhart.</p>
<p>‘Frankie, you become the archetypal compromise candidate. While all those other bastards are shooting and stabbing each other in public, you slip quietly through as the man they all hate least.’</p>
<p>‘That’s what the Social Democrats used to pin their hopes on. Remember them? And frankly I’m not sure I have much of a reputation as being the obvious compromise candidate.’</p>
<p>‘But the Social Democrats didn’t have my help or my bunch of newspapers behind them. You will. High risks, I know, Frankie. But then they are high rewards.’</p>
<p>‘What do I have to do?’</p>
<p>To catch the tide, your timing has to be right Frankly, I would be happier if there were a little time - perhaps a</p>
<p>month - between now and when the voting starts to give the other contenders time to tire, for their campaigns to ship a little water and to get everyone bored with the choice of candidates on offer. Then you discover a large press campaign promoting your late and unexpected entry into the race, which brings back an element of excitement and relief. The tide starts running with you, Francis.’</p>
<p>Urquhart rioted that Landless had called him by his proper name for the first time. The man was absolutely serious about his proposal. ‘So you want me to see if I can slow the election procedure down a little’</p>
<p>‘Can you do it?’</p>
<p>‘Although Humphrey Newlands runs the election, according to the Party’s constitution the timing of the</p>
<p>￼ballot is entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister, and he would do nothing to help Teddy Williams’ favoured candidate. So I think there’s a damned good chance…’</p>
<p>TUESDAY 26th OCTOBER</p>
<p>‘Prime Minister, I haven’t had a chance to speak with you since your announcement yesterday. I can’t tell you how shocked and - devastated I was.’</p>
<p>‘Francis, that’s very kind of you. But no sympathy, please. I feel absolutely content with the situation. In</p>
<p>any event, I have little time today for second thoughts. Humphrey Newlands is coming in twenty minutes so we</p>
<p>can get the leadership election process under way, then I’m off to spend the rest of the day with my brother Charles. It’s marvellous to have time for such things!’ he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Urquhart was astonished to see he meant every word of it.</p>
<p>‘Prime Minister, you don’t appear to be in a mood for maudlin sentiments, so I shan’t spend any time adding to them. But you must know how deeply saddened I am. As I listened to you yesterday I felt as if I… were falling out of the sky, quite literally. But enough- Let’s look forward, not back. It seems to me that some of our colleagues have served you rather badly in recent months, not showing the support you deserved. Now while you have already said you will not support any particular candidate in the election, I suspect you have some clear views as to whom you do not wish to get his hands on the leadership. As things stand at the moment I have no intention of becoming a candidate myself, so I thought you might like me to keep</p>
<p>you informed of what’s going on and give you some feedback from the Parliamentary Party on the state of play. I know you are not going to interfere, but perhaps that won’t stop you taking a close interest…’</p>
<p>They both knew that even a failed Party Leader in his last days still has enough influence to sway a crucial body of opinion within the Parliamentary Party. It is not only the favours he has accumulated from placemen over time, but also the not inconsiderable matter of his nominations for the Resignation Honours List, which every retiring Prime Minister is allowed to make. For many senior members of the Party, this would be their last chance to rise above the mob of ordinary parliamentarians and achieve the social status to which their wives had so long aspired.</p>
<p>‘Francis, that’s most understanding’ Collingridge was clearly in a relaxed and very trusting mood.’ You know, the</p>
<p>Prime Minister is expected to be aware of everything that’s going on but, as I have discovered to my cost, it’s so easy to</p>
<p>get isolated, to have events just slip past you without making any contact with them. I suspect dear old Sir</p>
<p>Humphrey is past giving the best intelligence on the state of parliamentary opinion, so I would very much welcome</p>
<p>your advice. As you so delicately put it, I shall certainly take a close interest in the matter of who is to succeed me. So tell me, how do things look?’</p>
<p>Tarry days yet, very difficult to tell. I trunk most of the press are right to suggest it’s an open race. But I would expect things to develop quickly once they get going.’</p>
<p>‘No front runners yet, then?’</p>
<p>‘Well, one perhaps who seems to have something of a head start. Michael Samuel.’ ‘Michael! Why so?’</p>
<p>‘Simply that it’s going to be a short and furious race, with little room for developing solid arguments or issues. In</p>
<p>those circumstances, the ones who use television well are going to have a strong advantage. And, of course, he’s going to have the strong if subtle support of Teddy and party headquarters.’</p>
<p>Collingridge’s face clouded. ‘Yes. I see what you mean.’ He drummed his fingers loudly on the arm of his chair, weighing his words carefully.</p>
<p>‘Francis, I shall be absolutely scrupulous in not favouring any candidate in this race. My only concern is to let the Party have a fair and free leadership election so they can make their own choice. But you make it sound as if the election won’t be as open as it perhaps should be, with party headquarters playing too influential a role’</p>
<p>He chose his words carefully, and uttered them slowly and softly. ‘I would not welcome that. I don’t think Teddy’s</p>
