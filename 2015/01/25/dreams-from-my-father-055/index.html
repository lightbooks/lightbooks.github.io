          <p>“It’s good to be here,” I said.</p>
<p>“You know it. Like a poet.” Roy laughed, sipping his beer.</p>
<p>“No, really, I mean it. It’s just good to be here, with you and Auma and everyone. It’s as if we-”</p>
<p>Before I could finish, we heard a bottle crash to the floor behind us. I spun around to see two men at the far side of the</p>
<p>courtyard pushing another, smaller, man down onto the ground. With one hand, the man on the ground appeared to be covering a cut on his head; with his free arm he was trying to shield himself from the swings of a billy club. I took a step forward, but Roy pulled me back.</p>
<p>“Mind your own business, brother,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“They may be police. I tell you, Barack, you don’t know what it’s like to spend a night in a Nairobi jail.”</p>
<p>By now, the man on the ground had curled up into a tight ball, trying to protect himself from the haphazard blows.</p>
<p>Then, like a trapped animal who senses an opening, the man suddenly jumped to his feet and climbed onto one of the tables to scramble over the wooden fence. His assailants looked as if they were going to give chase but apparently decided that it wasn’t worth it. One of them noticed Roy and me but said nothing, and together the two of them sauntered back inside. I suddenly felt very sober.</p>
<p>“That was terrible,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yah, well…you don’t know what the other guy did first.”</p>
<p>I rubbed the back of my neck. “When were you in jail anyway?”</p>
<p>Roy took another swig of beer and fell into one of the metal chairs. “The night David died.”</p>
<p>I sat down beside him and he told me the story. They had gone out to drink, he said, in search of a party. They had</p>
<p>taken Roy’s motorcycle to a nearby club, and there Roy had met a woman. He had taken a fancy to her, and they started talking. He had bought her a beer, but before long another man had come up and started getting in Roy’s face. The man said he was the woman’s husband and grabbed her by the arm. The woman struggled and fell, and Roy told the man to leave her alone. A fight broke out. The police came, and Roy didn’t have his identification papers, so they took him down to the station. He was thrown in a cell and left there for several hours, until David finally managed to get in to see him.</p>
<p>Give me the keys to the motorcycle, David had said, and I can get you the papers you need. No. Just go home.</p>
<p>You can’t stay here all night, brother. Give me the keys….</p>
<p>Roy stopped talking. We sat and stared at the shadows, oversized and faint off the lattice fence.</p>
<p>“It was an accident, Roy,” I said finally. “It wasn’t your fault. You need to let it go.”</p>
<p>Before I could say anything else, I heard Amy hollering behind us, her voice slurring slightly over the music. “Hey, you two! We’ve been looking all over for you!”</p>
<p>I started to wave her off, but Roy jerked out of his chair, tipping it to the ground.</p>
<p>“Come on, woman,” he said, taking Amy by the waist. “Let’s go dance.”</p>
<p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>
<p>A T FIVE-THIRTY IN the evening, our train rumbled out of the old Nairobi train station heading west for Kisumu. Jane had decided to stay behind, but the rest of the family was on board-Kezia, Zeituni, and Auma in one compartment; Roy, Bernard, and myself in the next. While everyone busied themselves with storing their luggage, I jiggled open a window and looked out at the curve of the tracks behind us, a line of track that had helped usher in Kenya’s colonial history.</p>
<p>The railway had been the single largest engineering effort in the history of the British Empire at the time it was built- six hundred miles long, from Mombasa on the Indian Ocean to the eastern shores of Lake Victoria. The project took five years to complete, as well as the lives of several hundred imported Indian workers. When it was finished, the British realized there were no passengers to help defray the costs of their conceit. And so the push for white settlers; the consolidation of lands that could be used to help lure newcomers; the cultivation of cash crops like coffee and tea; the necessity of an administrative apparatus that could extend as far as the tracks, into the heart of an unknown continent. And missions and churches to vanquish the fear that an unknown land produced.</p>
<p>It seemed like ancient history. And yet I knew that 1895, the year that the first beams were laid, had also been the year of my grandfather’s birth. It was the lands of that same man, Hussein Onyango, to which we were now traveling. The thought made the history of the train come alive for me, and I tried to imagine the sensations some nameless British officer might have felt on the train’s maiden voyage, as he sat in his gas-lit compartment and looked out over miles of receding bush. Would he have felt a sense of triumph, a confidence that the guiding light of Western civilization had finally penetrated the African darkness? Or did he feel a sense of foreboding, a sudden realization that the entire enterprise was an act of folly, that this land and its people would outlast imperial dreams? I tried to imagine the African on the other side of the glass window, watching this snake of steel and black smoke passing his village for the first time. Would he have looked at the train with envy, imagining himself one day sitting in the car where the Englishman sat, the load of his days somehow eased? Or would he have shuddered with visions of ruin and war?</p>
<p>My imagination failed me, and I returned to the present landscape, no longer bush but the rooftops of Mathare stretching into the foothills beyond. Passing one of the slum’s open-air markets, I saw a row of small boys wave to the train. I waved back, and heard Kezia’s voice, speaking in Luo, behind me. Bernard yanked on my shirt.</p>
<p>“She says you should keep your head inside. Those boys will throw stones at you.”</p>
<p>One of the train’s crew came in to take our bedding order and tell us that food service had started, and so we all went into the dining car and found ourselves a table. The car was a picture of faded elegance-the original wood paneling still intact but dull, the silver real but not perfectly matched. The food was just fine, though, and the beer served cold, and by the end of the meal I was feeling content.</p>
<p>“How long will it take to get to Home Square?” I asked, wiping the last bit of sauce off my plate.</p>
<p>“All night to Kisumu,” Auma said. “We’ll take a bus or matatu from there-another five hours, maybe.”</p>
<p>“By the way,” Roy said to me, lighting a cigarette, “it’s not Home Square. It’s Home Squared.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s something the kids in Nairobi used to say,” Auma explained. “There’s your ordinary house in Nairobi. And then</p>
<p>there’s your house in the country, where your people come from. Your ancestral home. Even the biggest minister or businessman thinks this way. He may have a mansion in Nairobi and build only a small hut on his land in the country. He may go there only once or twice a year. But if you ask him where he is from, he will tell you that that hut is his true home. So, when we were at school and wanted to tell somebody we were going to Alego, it was home twice over, you see. Home Squared.”</p>
<p>Roy took a sip of his beer. “For you, Barack, we can call it Home Cubed.”</p>
<p>Auma smiled and leaned back in her seat, listening to the rhythm of the train on the tracks. “This train brings back so many memories. You remember, Roy, how much we used to look forward to going home? It is so beautiful, Barack! Not at all like Nairobi. And Granny-she’s so much fun! Oh, you will like her, Barack. She has such a good sense of humor.”</p>
<p>“She had to have a good sense of humor,” Roy said, “living with the Terror for so long.”</p>
<p>“Who’s the Terror?”</p>
<p>Auma said, “That’s what we used to call our grandfather. Because he was so mean.”</p>
<p>Roy shook his head and laughed. “Wow, that guy was mean! He would make you sit at the table for dinner, and</p>
<p>served the food on china, like an Englishman. If you said one wrong thing, or used the wrong fork-pow! He would hit you with his stick. Sometimes when he hit you, you wouldn’t even know why until the next day.”</p>
<p>Zeituni waved them off, unimpressed. “Ah, you children knew him only when he was old and weak. When he was younger, aay! I was his favorite, you know. His pet. But still, if I did something wrong, I would hide from him all day, I would be so scared! You know, he was strict even with his guests. If they came to his house, he would kill many chickens in their honor. But if they broke custom, like washing their hands before someone who was older, he would have no hesitation in hitting them, even the adults.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t sound like he was real popular,” I said.</p>
<p>Zeituni shook her head. “Actually, he was well respected because he was such a good farmer. His compound in Alego was one of the biggest in the area. He had such a green thumb, he could make anything grow. He had studied these techniques from the British, you see. When he worked for them as a cook.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know he was a cook.”</p>
<p>“He had his lands, but for a long time he was a cook for wazungu in Nairobi. He worked for some very important people. During the World War he served a captain in the British army.”</p>
<p>Roy ordered another beer. “Maybe that’s what made him so mean.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zeituni said. “I think my father was always that way. Very strict. But fair. I will tell you one story I remember, from when I was only a young girl. One day a man came to the edge of our compound with a goat on a leash. He wanted to pass through our land, because he lived on the other side, and he didn’t want to walk around. So your grandfather told this man, ‘When you are alone, you are always free to pass through my land. But today you cannot pass, because your goat will eat my plants.’ Well, this man would not listen. He argued for a long time with your grandfather, saying that he would be careful and that the goat would do no harm. This man talked so much your grandfather finally called me over and said, ‘Go bring me Alego.’ That’s what he called his panga, you see-”</p>
<p>“His machete.”</p>
<p>“Yes, his machete. He had two that he kept very, very sharp. He would rub them on a stone all day. One panga he called Alego. The other he called Kogelo. So I ran back to his hut and brought him the one he called Alego. And now your grandfather tells this man, ‘See here. I have already told you that you should not pass, but you are too stubborn to listen. So now I will make a bargain with you. You can pass with your goat. But if even one leaf is harmed-if even one half of one leaf of my plants is harmed-then I will cut down your goat also.’</p>
<p>“Well, even though I was very young at the time, I knew that this man must be so stupid, because he accepted my father’s offer. We began to walk, the man and his goat in front, me and the old man following closely behind. We had walked maybe twenty steps when the goat stuck out its neck and started nibbling at a leaf. Then-Whoosh! My dad cut one side of the goat’s head clean through. The goat owner was shocked, and started to cry out. ‘Aalieey! Aaiieey! What have you done now, Hussein Onyango.’ And your grandfather just wiped off his panga and said, ‘If I say I will do something, I must do it. Otherwise how will people know that my word is true?’ Later, the owner of the goat tried to sue your grandfather before the council of elders. The elders all felt pity for the man, for the death of a goat was not such a small thing. But when they heard his story, they had to send him away. They knew that your grandfather was right, because the man had been warned.”</p>
