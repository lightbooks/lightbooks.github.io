          <p>“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.<br>“Not in an educated society with a well-run government. Prices should actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower prices, but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money’s power.”<br>“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “Aren’t you encouraging me to go to business school for my master’s degree?”<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad angrily.<br>“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions, first by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again resisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you were again learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged. That’s the first step.”<br>“Why is that step so important” I asked.<br>“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take you boys into the briar patch. That place where almost everyone else avoids. I’ll take you to that place where most people are afraid to go. If you go with me, you’ll let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn to have money work for you.”<br>“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to learn from you? What will we get?” I asked.<br>“The same thing Briar Rabbit got,” said rich dad. “Freedom from the Tar Baby.”<br>“Is there a briar patch?” I asked.<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and our greed. Going into our fear and confronting our greed, our weaknesses, our neediness is the way out. And the way out is through the mind, by choosing our thoughts.”<br>“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled.<br>“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. Instead of just getting up and going to work to solve your problems, just because the fear of not having the money to pay your bills is scaring you. Thinking would be taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question like, Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are so terrified at not telling themselves the truth-that fear is in control-that they cannot think, and instead run out the door. Tar baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing your thoughts.”<br>“And how do we do that?” Mike asked.<br>“That’s what I will be teaching you. I’ll be teaching you to have a choice of thoughts to consider, rather than knee-jerk reacting, like gulping down your morning coffee and running out the door.<br>“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it’s short term. It’s the bills at the end of the month, the Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money. So they do as their parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time to say, Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.”<br>“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking?” Mike asked.<br>“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like, Well, everyone has to work.’ Or The rich are crooks.’ Or I’ll get another job. I deserve this raise. You can’t push me around.’ Or I like this job because it’s secure.’ Instead of, Is there something I’m missing here?’ which breaks the emotional thought, and gives you time to think clearly.”<br>I must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone was speaking out of emotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that served me well for life. Especially when I was the one speaking out of reaction and not from clear thought.<br>As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really did “make money.” They did not work for it. He went on to explain that when Mike and I were casting 5-cent pieces out of lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think. The problem was that it was illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to do it, but not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways.<br>Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people thinking that money is real. Money is really made up. It was only because of the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that the house of cards stood standing. “In fact,” he said, “in many ways the donkey’s carrot was more valuable than money.”<br>He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and our dollars would no longer be silver certificates.<br>“When that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose. The poor, the middle class and the ignorant will have their lives ruined simply because they will continue to believe that money is real and that the company they work for, or the government, will look after them.”<br>We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but over the years it made more and more sense.<br>Seeing What Others Miss</p>
<p>As he climbed into his pickup truck, outside of his little convenience store, he said, “Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. Opportunities right in front of their noses. Most people never see these opportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s all they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you will see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you something else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps. You’ll never, ever, touch that Tar Baby.”<br>Mike and I picked up our things from the store and waved goodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went back to the park, to the same picnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking.<br>We spent the next week at school, thinking and talking. For two more weeks, we kept thinking, talking, and working for free.<br>At the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye to Mrs. Martin and looking at the comic-book stand with a longing gaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every Saturday was that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as Mrs. Martin was saying goodbye to Mike and me, I saw something she was doing that I had never seen her do before. I mean, I had seen her do it, but I never took notice of it.<br>Mrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. She was keeping the top half of the comic book cover and throwing the rest of the comic book into a large brown cardboard box. When I asked her what she did with the comic books, she said, “I throw them away. I give the top half of the cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings in the new comics. He’s coming in an hour.”<br>Mike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived and I asked him if we could have the comic books. To which he replied, “You can have them if you work for this store and do not resell them.”<br>Our partnership was revived. Mike’s mom had a spare room in the basement that no one used. We cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in that room. Soon our comic-book library was open to the public. We hired Mike’s younger sister, who loved to study, to be head librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library, which was open from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. every day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood, could read as many comics as they could in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a comic costs 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours.<br>Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left, to make sure they weren’t borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, and any comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week over a threemonth period. We paid his sister $1 a week and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she was always studying.<br>Mike and F kept our agreement by working in the store every Saturday and collecting all the comic books from the different stores. We kept our agreement to the distributor by not selling any comic books. We burned them once they got too tattered. We tried opening a branch office, but we could never quite find someone as dedicated as Mike’s sister we could trust.<br>At an early age, we found out how hard it was to find good staff.<br>Three months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in the room. Some bullies from another neighborhood pushed their way in and started it. Mike’s dad suggested we shut down the business. So our comic-book business shut down, and we stopped working on Saturdays at the convenience store. Anyway, rich dad was excited because he had new things he wanted to teach us. He was happy because we had learned our first lesson so well. We had learned to have money work for us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced to use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money. By starting our own business, the comic-book library, we were in control of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. The best part was that our business generated money for us, even when we weren’t physically there. Our money worked for us. Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much more.</p>
<p>CHAPTER THREE<br>Lesson Two:Why Teach Financial Literacy?</p>
<p>In 1990, my best friend, Mike, took over his father’s empire and is, in fact, doing a better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice a year on the golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us.<br>In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife, Kim, was 37. Retirement does not mean not working. To my wife and me, it means that barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, staying way ahead of inflation. I guess it means freedom. The assets are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You water it for years and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. It’s roots have gone down deep enough. Then, the tree provides shade for your enjoyment.<br>Mike chose to run the empire and I chose to retire.</p>
