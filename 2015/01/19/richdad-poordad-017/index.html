          <p>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him that she had left him $35,000. That is what was left of her estate after the attorney and the government took their shares.  Immediately, he saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this money to advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine that targeted the very rich. The ad ran for three months.  He received no replies from the ad, and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for misrepresentation.<br>This is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned, his only reply was that “advertising salespeople are crooks.” I then asked him if he would be willing to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the time, and I don’t want to waste my money.”<br>The world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they’re ?poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not      f because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald’s does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best at  f selling and delivering a basic average burger.<br>Poor dad wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to be paid more. Even after being told by the governor of Hawaii that he could no longer work in state government, my educated dad continued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad then took up the cause of the teachers union, campaigning for further protection and benefits for I these highly skilled and educated professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that overspecialization is what caused the need for union protection. He never understood that the more specialized you become, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty.<br>Rich dad advised that Mike and I “groom” ourselves. Many corporations do the same thing. They find a young bright student out of business school and begin “grooming” that person to someday take over the company.  So these bright young employees do not specialize in one department; they are moved from department to department to learn all the aspects of business systems. The rich often “groom” their children or the children of others.  By doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the various departments interrelate.<br>For the World War II generation, it was considered “bad” to skip from company to company. Today, it is considered smart.  Since people will skip from company to company, rather than seek greater specialization, why not seek to “learn” more than “earn.” In the short term, it may earn you less.  In the long term, it will pay off in large dividends.<br>The main management skills needed for success are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The management of cash flow</li>
<li>The management of systems (including yourself and time with family).</li>
<li>The management of people.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing. It is the ability to sell—therefore, to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill of personal success. It is communication skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that I work on constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my knowledge.<br>As I have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder and harder the more competent he became. He also became more trapped the more specialized he got. Although his salary went up, his choices diminished. Soon after he was locked out of government work, he found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. It is like professional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play. Their once high-paying position is gone, and they have limited skills to fall back on. I think that is why my educated dad sided so much with unions after that. He realized how much a union would have benefited him.<br>Rich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot. He encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to bring smart people together to work as a team. Today it would be called a synergy of professional specialities.<br>Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. They earn that much because they have specialized skills in their field as well as other skills. They can teach as well as sell and market. I know of no other skills to be more important than selling as well as marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better you are at communicating, negotiating and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that newspaper writer who wanted to become a “best-selling author,” I advise anyone else today.  Being technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses.  I have friends who are geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with other human beings and, as a result, their earnings are pitiful.  I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn nothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless.<br>In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to receive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and receiving. I know many people who are poor because they are neither good students nor good teachers.<br>Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave lots of money away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He knew that to receive money, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families. That is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These are organizations designed to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in perpetuity.<br>My educated dad always said, “When I have some extra money, I’ll give it.” The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw more money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: “Give and you shall receive.” Instead, he believed in “Receive and then you give.”<br>In conclusion, I became both dads.  One part of me is a hard-core capitalist who loves the game of money making money. The other side is ‘: a socially responsible teacher who is deeply concerned with this ever-widening gap between the haves and have nots. I personally hold the archaic educational system primarily responsible for this growing gap.</p>
<p>CHAPTER EIGHT<br>Overcoming Obstacles</p>
<p>Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may still face roadblocks to becoming financially independent. There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns. Asset columns that could produce large sums of cash flow. Asset columns that could free them to live the life they dream of, instead of working full time just to pay bills. The five reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fear.</li>
<li>Cynicism.</li>
<li>Laziness.</li>
<li>Bad habits.</li>
<li>Arrogance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reason No. 1. Overcoming the fear of losing money. I have never met anyone who really likes losing money. And in all my years, I have never met a rich person who has never lost money. But I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime. . .investing, that is.<br>The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it’s not fear that is the problem. It’s how you handle fear. It’s how you handle losing.  It’s how you handle failure that makes the difference in one’s life. That goes for anything in life, not just money. The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they handle that fear.<br>It’s OK to be fearful. It’s OK to be a coward when it comes to money. You can still be rich. We’re all heroes at something and cowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency room nurse. When ; she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention investing, she runs’j away. When I see blood, I don’t run.  I pass out. My rich dad understood phobias about money.  “Some people are terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both are phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing money was this little rhyme: “If you hate risk and worry. . .start early.”<br>That’s why banks recommend savings as a habit when you’re young. J If you start young, it’s easy to be rich. I won’t go into it here, but there is a large difference between a person who starts saving at age 20 versus age 30. A staggering difference.<br>It is said that one of the wonders of the world is the power of compound interest. The purchase of Manhattan Island is said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was purchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet, if that $24 had been invested, at 8 percent annually, that $24 would have been worth more than $28 trillion by 1995, Manhattan could be repurchased with money left over to buy much of L.A., especially at 1995’s real estate prices.<br>My neighbor works for a major computer company. He has been there 25 years. In five more years he will leave the company with $4 million in his 401k retirement plan. It is invested mostly in high-growth mutual funds, which he will convert to bonds and government securities. He’ll only be 55 when he gets out, and he will have -a passive cash flow of over $300,000 a year, more than he makes from his salary.  So it can be done, even if you hate losing or hate risk. But you must start early and definitely set up a retirement plan, and you should hire a financial planner you trust to guide you before investing in anything.<br>But what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire early? How do you handle the fear of losing money?<br>My poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing to discuss the subject.<br>My rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think like a Texan.  “I like Texas and Texans,” he used to say.  “In Texas, everything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And when they lose, it’s spectacular.”<br>“They like losing?” I asked.<br>“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy loser, and I’ll show you a loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude toward risk, reward and failure I’m talking about. It’s how they handle life. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living like roaches when it comes to money. Roaches terrified that someone will shine a light on them. Whimpering when the grocery clerk short changes them a quarter.”<br>Rich dad went on to explain.<br>“What I like best is the Texas attitude. They’re proud when they win, and they brag when they lose. Texans have a saying, “If you’re going to go broke, go big. You don’t want to admit you went broke over a duplex. Most people around here are so afraid of losing, they don’t have a duplex to go broke with.”</p>
