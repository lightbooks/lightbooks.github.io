          <p>“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.<br>“No, it doesn’t. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.”<br>“Even rich people?” Mike asked.<br>“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They’re terrified of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars, the high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and have more money.”<br>“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.<br>“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”<br>As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with great interest, when before we probably would have just ignored him.<br>Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, took the bill, thanked rich dad profusely and hurried off ecstatic with his good fortune.<br>“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich dad. “I’ve met so many people who say, <code>Oh, I&#39;m not interested in money.&#39; Yet they&#39;ll work at a job for eight hours a day. That&#39;s a denial of truth. If they weren&#39;t interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.&quot;
As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind was flashing back to the countless times my own dad said, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in money.&quot; He said those words often. He also covered himself by always saying, &quot;I work because I love my job.&quot;
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; I asked. &quot;Not work for money until all traces of fear and greed are gone?&quot;
&quot;No, that would be a waste of time,&quot; said rich dad. &quot;Emotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word</code>emotion’ stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.”<br>“Whoa!” said Mike.<br>“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to come. just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your own thinking.”<br>“Can you give me an example?” I asked.<br>“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, <code>I need to find a job,&#39; it&#39;s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not having money generates that thought.&quot;
&quot;But people do need money if they have bills to pay,&quot; I said.
&quot;Sure they do,&quot; smiled rich dad. &quot;All I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s fear that is all too often doing the thinking.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Mike.
&quot;For example,&quot; said rich dad. &quot;If the fear of not having enough money arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job so they can earn a few bucks to kill the fear, they instead might ask themselves this question.</code>Will a job be the best solution to this fear over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is <code>no.&#39; Especially when you look over a person&#39;s lifetime. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.&quot;
&quot;But my dad is always saying,</code>Stay in school, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job.’ I spoke out, somewhat confused.<br>“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people recommend that, and it’s a good idea for most people. But people make that recommendation primarily out of fear.”<br>“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”<br>“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t be able to earn money and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is justified. An education and a job are important. But it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same fear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so fanatical about you going to school.”<br>“So what do you recommend?” I asked.<br>“I want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. And they don’t teach that in school. If you don’t learn it, you become a slave to money.”<br>It was finally making sense. He did want us to widen our views. To . see what Mrs. Martin could not see, his employees could not see, or my dad for that matter. He used examples that sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten them. My vision widened that day, and I could begin to see the trap that lay ahead for most people.<br>“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid the trap. The trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in your favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not interested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t handle the fear or desire. If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a high-paid slave.”<br>“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.<br>“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It’s selfinflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you boys go to school and get your college degrees. I’ll teach you how to stay out of the trap.”<br>The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a great education and a great career. But school never told him how to handle money or his fears. It became clear that I could learn different and important things from two fathers.<br>“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the desire of money affect our thinking?” Mike asked.<br>“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice your desires rising?”<br>We nodded our heads.<br>“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is most important. We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most important for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not simply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of a donkey, dragging a cart, with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of the donkey’s nose. The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another carrot for the donkey.”<br>“You mean the moment I began to picture a new baseball glove, candy and toys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.<br>“Yeah. And as you get older, your toys get more expensive. A new car, a boat and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you. Enticing you toward the rocks. That’s the trap.”<br>“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.<br>“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get. Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”<br>Rich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle between ignorance and illumination.<br>He explained that once a person stops searching for information and knowledge of one’s self, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment decision-to learn to open or close one’s mind.<br>“Look, school is very, very important. You go to school to learn a skill or profession so as to be a contributing member of society. Every culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, business people, police officers, firefighters, soldiers. Schools train them so our culture can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people, school is the end, not the beginning.”<br>There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I did not comprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great teachers, whose words continue to teach for years, often long after they’re gone, his words are still with me today.<br>“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “Cruel for a reason. I want you to always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. I want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two emotions, fear and desire, can lead you into life’s biggest trap, if you’re not aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”<br>A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw it back.<br>“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked.<br>“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees. By raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone. Now, it hurts the poor people the most, so poor people have worse health than those with money.<br>“Because the doctors raise their rates, the attorneys raise their rates. Because the attorneys’ rates have gone up, schoolteachers want a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon, there will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break out and another great civilization will collapse. Great civilizations collapsed when the gap between the haves and havenots was too great. America is on the same course, proving once again that history repeats itself, because we do not learn from history. We only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson.</p>
