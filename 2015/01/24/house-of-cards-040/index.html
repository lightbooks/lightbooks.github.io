          <p>‘I… I don’t know for sure. But I think he blamed himself so badly over the shares.’</p>
<p>“The shares? You mean the Renox shares?’ said Mattie in alarm.</p>
<p>‘Charles Collingridge asked him to open the accommodation address because he wanted somewhere for his private mail. Roger and I went to Paddington in a taxi, and he sent me in to do the paper work. I knew he felt uneasy at the time, I think he sensed there was something wrong. And when he realised what it had been used for and how much trouble it had caused, he just began going to pieces.’</p>
<p>‘Why did Mr Collingridge ask Roger to open the address and not do it himself ?’</p>
<p>I’ve no idea, really. Perhaps he felt guilty because of what he was going to use it for. Roger just breezed into the office one day during the summer and said he’d got a favour to do for Charles Collingridge, that it was terribly confidential and I was to breathe a word to no one.’</p>
<p>Her words reminded her that she had broken her promise - of silence and more tears began to flow, but Mattie soon reassured her, and they continued their walk.</p>
<p>‘So you never saw Charles Collingridge yourself ?’</p>
<p>‘No. I’ve never really met him at all. Roger likes to handle all the important people himself, and as far as I’m aware Mr Collingridge has never come into the office.’</p>
<p>‘But you are sure it was Charles Collingridge?’</p>
<p>￼’Of course, Roger said so. And who else could it have been?’ The dampness began to appear again at the comer of her eyes. She shivered violently as a burst of cold November air from across the river sent the dead autumnal leaves cascading around them. ‘Oh, God, it’s all such an awful mess.’</p>
<p>‘Penny, relax! It will be all right. Why don’t you take a couple of days off and let Roger take care of himself? He can survive without you for a little while. He knows how to use the office computer, doesn’t he?’</p>
<p>‘He can struggle through on the basics reasonably well if I’m not around, but even he wouldn’t pretend he’s a keyboard magician. No, I’ll be all right.’</p>
<p>So it was O’Neill who had ‘struggled through’ with the computer file. Another piece fell into place in Mattie’s mind. She didn’t feel comfortable squeezing information out of a vulnerable and trusting secretary, but there was no alternative.</p>
<p>look, how can I put this… Roger sounds as if he is very unwell. He’s obviously been under a lot of strain, and he might be having a breakdown. Perhaps he’s drinking too much. I’m not a doctor, but I do know one who’s very good at that sort of thing. If you need any help, please give me a call.’</p>
<p>They had arrived back in Smith Square by now, and prepared to part. ‘Mattie, thank you. You’ve been a great help.’</p>
<p>‘No, Penny. I’m the one who is grateful. Take care of yourself.’</p>
<p>Mattie walked the few hundred yards back to the House of Commons, oblivious of the chill and wondering why on earth Roger O’Neill had framed Charles and Henry Collingridge.</p>
<p>￼TUESDAY 16th NOVEMBER - WEDNESDAY 17th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>Urquhart declared his intention to seek the leadership of the Party at a press conference held in the House of Commons at 5 p.m., timed to catch the early evening TV news and the first editions of the following day’s press. The surroundings afforded by the meeting room in the Palace of Westminster, with its noble carved stone fireplace, its dark oak panelling and its traditional atmosphere of authority gave the proceedings a dignity which the announcements of Samuel, Woolton and others had lacked. Urquhart succeeded in establishing the impression of a man who was being dragged reluctantly towards the seat of power, placing his duty to his colleagues and country above his own, modest personal interests.</p>
<p>It was seventeen hours later, on Wednesday morning, that Landless held his own press conference. He sat in one of the palatial reception rooms of the Ritz Hotel at a long table covered with microphones, facing the cameras and questions of the financial press. Alongside him and almost dwarfed by his bulging girth sat Marcus Frobisher, the Chairman of the United Newspapers Group who, although an industrial magnate in his own right, was clearly cast to play a secondary role on this occasion. Behind them for the benefit of the cameras had been erected a vast backdrop with the colourful logo TEN’ carefully crafted upon it and highlighted with lasers. To one side was a large video screen, on which was playing a corporate video featuring some of the Telegraph’s better advertising material interspersed with cuts of Landless being greeted by workers, pulling levers to start the printing presses and generally running his empire in a warm and personal manner. The press conference, for all its immediacy, had clearly been carefully planned.</p>
<p>‘Good morning ladies and gentlemen.’</p>
<p>Landless called the throng to order in a voice which was considerably less cockney than the one he adopted on private occasions. ‘Thank you for corning at such short notice. We have invited you here to tell you about one of the most exciting steps forward for the British communications industry since Julius Renter established his telegraph service in London more than a hundred years ago.’.</p>
<p>He shifted one of the microphones a little closer to stop himself craning his neck. ‘Today we wish to announce the creation of the largest newspaper group in the United Kingdom, which will provide a platform for making this country once again the worldwide leader in the rapidly expanding industry of providing information services.</p>
<p>‘Telegraph Newspapers has made an offer to purchase the full issued share capital of the United Newspapers Group at a price which values them at £’I.4 billion, a premium of 40 per cent above the current market price. I am delighted to say that the board of the United Newspapers Group has unanimously accepted the bid, and also agreed the terms for the future management of the combined group. I shall become Chairman and Chief Executive of the new company, and my good friend and former competitor, now colleague.. .’ he stretched a huge paw to grasp the arm of Frobisher, as menacingly as if he were grasping him around the neck -‘… is to be the President’</p>
<p>Several nodding heads around the room indicated that they clearly understood which of the men would be in sole charge of the new operation. Frobisher sat there trying hard to put on a good face.</p>
<p>‘This is an important step for the British newspaper industry. The combined operation will control more national and major regional titles than any other newspaper group in this country, and the amalgamation of our international subsidiaries will make us the third largest newspaper group in the world. To mark this new departure we are renaming the company, and as you can see, our new corporate title will be Telegraph Express Newspapers Company PLC - TEN’ He at last released his grip on Frobisher and waved at the logo behind.</p>
<p>‘Do you like my new corporate design?’ he asked jovially. He hoped they did. His daughter’s two-woman partnership had been given the</p>
<p>contract - its first-for devising the company’s new name and corporate design, and he was determined that she be given almost as much attention as himself.</p>
<p>You will find waiting for you at the door a document which gives the full details of the offer and agreement. So, questions please!’ There was an excited hum from the audience, and a forest of hands shot up to catch his eye.</p>
<p>‘I suppose to be fair I ought to take the first question from someone who will not be working for the group,’ jested Landless. ‘Now, can we find anyone here who won’t be part of the new team?’ With theatrical exaggeration he shielded his eyes from the bright lights and searched the audience for a suitable victim, and they all laughed at his cheek..</p>
<p>‘Mr Landless,’ shouted the business editor of the Sunday Times. The Government have made it very clear in recent years that they feel the British newspaper industry is already concentrated into too few hands, and that they would use their powers under the monopolies and mergers legislation to prevent any further consolidation. How on earth do you expect to get the necessary Government approval for this deal?’</p>
<p>There was a strong murmur of assent to the question from around the room. The Government had made loud if imprecise noises during the election about their commitment to increasing industrial competition.</p>
<p>‘An excellent point’ Landless spread his arms wide as if to hug the question to his chest and slowly throttle it to death.</p>
<p>You are right, the Government will need to take a view on the matter. And I hope they will be sufficiently wise and visionary to realise that the operation we are putting together, far from jeopardising the British newspaper industry, is vital to its continuing success. Newspapers are just part of the worldwide information industry, which is growing and changing every day. You all know that. Five years ago you all worked in Fleet Street with old typewriters and printing presses which should have been scrapped when the Kaiser surrendered. Today the industry is modernised, decentralised, computerised. Yet still it must keep changing. It has more competition, from satellite television, local radio, breakfast TV and the rest’</p>
<p>‘Shame!’ cried a voice within the audience, and they laughed nostalgically about the cosy days of Fleet Street and El Vino’s wine bar, and the</p>
<p>￼prolonged printers’ strikes and disputes which allowed them weeks or even months off to write books or build boats and dream dreams while still on full pay. But they all recognised the inescapable truth in what Landless was saying.</p>
<p>In ten years’ time more and more people will be demanding information twenty-four hours a day, from all parts of the world. Fewer and fewer of them will be getting that information from newspapers which arrive hours after the news has occurred and which covers them in filthy printing ink. If we are to survive in business we must no longer think of ourselves as parochial newspaper men, but as suppliers of information on a worldwide basis. So our new group, “TEN”, will not just be a traditional newspaper business but will be grown into the world’s leading supplier of information to business and homes around the world, whether they want that information printed, televised, computerised or sung by canaries. And to do that we .need the size, the muscle and the resources which only a large group such as “TEN” can provide.’</p>
<p>He gestured generously towards the questioner. ‘And as you so rightly point out, we also need the</p>
<p>Government’s permission. So the Government have a choice. They can take the narrow view, prohibit the merger and preside over the decline of the British newspaper industry, which will be dead within ten years as the Americans, Japanese and even Australians take over. Or they can be responsible and visionary, and care about the jobs which exist and which can be created in the industry, and think not about narrow British competition but about the much broader international competition which we need to take on and beat if we are to survive. If they do that, they will allow us to build the biggest and finest information service in the world, based right here in Britain’.</p>
<p>A blitz of flash guns greeted him as he sat back in his chair, the carefully rehearsed appeal finished while the journalists who still took shorthand scribbled furiously to catch up with him. The questioner turned to his neighbour.</p>
