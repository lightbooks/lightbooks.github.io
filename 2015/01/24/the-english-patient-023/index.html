<p>￼￼￼“He was strange that night.”</p>
<p>“He was very strange, because I gave him an extra dose of morphine. Do you remember the names? He put out about eight names. Five of them were obvious jokes. Then three names. Cicero. Zerzura. Delilah.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“ ‘Cicero’ was a code name for a spy. The British unearthed him. A double then triple agent. He got away. ‘Zerzura’ is more complicated.”</p>
<p>“I know about Zerzura. He’s talked about it. He also talks about gardens.”</p>
<p>“But it is mostly the desert now. The English garden is wearing thin. He’s dying. I think you have the spy-helper Almasy upstairs.”</p>
<p>They sit on the old cane hampers of the linen room looking at each other. Caravaggio shrugs. “It’s possible.”</p>
<p>“I think he is an Englishman,” she says, sucking in her cheeks as she always does when she is thinking or considering something about herself.</p>
<p>“I know you love the man, but he’s not an Englishman. In the early part of the war I was working in Cairo—the Tripoli Axis. Rommel’s Rebecca spy—”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘Rebecca spy’?”</p>
<p>“In 1942 the Germans sent a spy called Eppler into Cairo before the battle of El Alamein. He used a copy of Daphne du Maurier’s novel Rebecca as a code book to send messages back to Rommel on troop movements. Listen, the book became bed¬side reading with British Intelligence. Even I read it.”</p>
<p>“You read a book?”</p>
<p>“Thank you. The man who guided Eppler through the desert into Cairo on Rommel’s personal orders—from Tripoli all the way to Cairo—was Count Ladislaus de Almasy. This was a stretch of desert that, it was assumed, no one could cross.</p>
<p>“Between the wars Almasy had English friends. Great ex¬plorers. But when war broke out he went with the Germans. Rommel asked him to take Eppler across the desert into Cairo because it would have been too obvious by plane or parachute. He crossed the desert with the guy and delivered him to the Nile delta.”</p>
<p>“You know a lot about this.”</p>

<p>￼￼￼“I was based in Cairo. We were tracking them. From Gialo he led a company of eight men into the desert. They had to keep digging the trucks out of the sand hills. He aimed them towards Uweinat and its granite plateau so they could get water, take shelter in the caves. It was a halfway point. In the 19305 he had discovered caves with rock paintings there. But the plateau was crawling with Allies and he couldn’t use the wells there. He struck out into the sand desert again. They raided British petrol dumps to fill up their tanks. In the Kharga Oasis they switched into British uniforms and hung British army number plates on their vehicles. When they were spotted from the air they hid in the wadis for as long as three days, completely still. Baking to death in the sand.</p>
<p>“It took them three weeks to reach Cairo. Almdsy shook hands with Eppler and left him. This is where we lost him. He turned and went back into the desert alone. We think he crossed it again, back towards Tripoli. But that was the last time he was ever seen. The British picked up Eppler even¬tually and used the Rebecca code to feed false information to Rommel about El Alamein.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t believe it, David.”</p>
<p>“The man who helped catch Eppler in Cairo was named Sansom.” “Delilah.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s Sansom.”</p>
<p>“I thought that at first. He was very like Almdsy. A desert lover as well. He had spent his childhood in the Levant and knew the Bedouin. But the thing about Almasy was, he could fly. We are talking about someone who crashed in a plane. Here is this man, burned beyond recognition, who somehow ends up in the arms of the English at Pisa. Also, he can get away with sounding English. Almdsy went to school in Eng¬land. In Cairo he was referred to as the English spy.”</p>
<p>She sat on the hamper watching Caravaggio. She said, “I think we should leave him be. It doesn’t matter what side he was on, does it?”</p>
<p>Caravaggio said, “I’d like to talk with him some more. With more morphine in him. Talking it out. Both of us. Do you understand? To see where it will all go. Delilah. Zerzura. You will have to give him the altered shot.”</p>
<p>“No, David. You’re too obsessed. It doesn’t matter who he is. The war’s over.”</p>
<p>“I will then. I’ll cook up a Brompton cocktail. Morphine and alcohol. They invented it at Brompton Hospital in London for their cancer patients. Don’t worry, it won’t kill him. It absorbs fast into the body. I can put it together with what we’ve got. Give him a drink of it. Then put him back on straight morphine.”</p>

<p>￼￼￼She watched him sitting on the hamper, clear-eyed, smil¬ing. During the last stages of the war Caravaggio had become one of the numerous morphia thieves. He had sniffed out her medical supplies within hours of his arrival. The small tubes of morphine were now a source for him. Like toothpaste tubes for dolls, she had thought when she first saw them, finding them utterly quaint. Caravaggio carried two or three in his pocket all day long, slipping the fluid into his flesh. She had stumbled on him once vomiting from its excess, crouched and shaking in one of the dark corners of the villa, looking up and hardly recognizing her. She had tried speaking with him and he had stared back. He had found the metal supply box, torn it open with God knows what strength. Once when the sapper cut open the palm of his hand on an iron gate, Caravag¬gio broke the glass tip off with his teeth, sucked and spat the morphine onto the brown hand before Kip even knew what it was. Kip pushing him away, glaring in anger.</p>
<p>“Leave him alone. He’s my patient.”</p>
<p>“I won’t damage him. The morphine and alcohol will take away the pain.”</p>
<p>(3 CC’s BROMPTON COCKTAIL. 3:00 P.M.)</p>
<p>Caravaggio slips the book out of the man’s hands.</p>
<p>“When you crashed in the desert—where were you flying from?”</p>
<p>“I was leaving the Gilf Kebir. I had gone there to collect someone. In late August. Nineteen forty-two.”</p>
<p>“During the war? Everyone must have left by then.”</p>
<p>“Yes. There were just armies.”</p>
<p>“The Gilf Kebir.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>“Give me the Kipling book… here.”</p>
<p>On the frontispiece of Kirn was a map with a dotted line for the path the boy and the Holy One took. It showed just a portion of India—a darkly cross-hatched Afghanistan, and Kashmir in the lap of the mountains.</p>
<p>He traces his black hand along the Numi River till it enters the sea at 23°3o’ latitude. He continues sliding his finger seven inches west, off the page, onto his chest; he touches his rib.</p>

<p>￼￼￼“Here. The Gilf Kebir, just north of the Tropic of Cancer. On the Egyptian-Libyan border.”</p>
<p>What happened in 1942?</p>
<p>I had made the journey to Cairo and was returning from there. I was slipping between the enemy, remembering old maps, hitting the pre-war caches of petrol and water, driving towards Uweinat. It was easier now that I was alone. Miles from the Gilf Kebir, the truck exploded and I capsized, rolling automatically into the sand, not wanting a spark to touch me. In the desert one is always frightened of fire.</p>
<p>The truck exploded, probably sabotaged. There were spies among the Bedouin, whose caravans continued to drift like cities, carrying spice, rooms, government advisors wherever they went. At any given moment among the Bedouin in those days of the war, there were Englishmen as well as Germans.</p>
<p>Leaving the truck, I started walking towards Uweinat, where I knew there was a buried plane.</p>
<p>Wait. What do you mean, a buried plane?</p>
<p>Madox had an old plane in the early days, which he had shaved down to the essentials—the only “extra” was the closed bubble of cockpit, crucial for desert flights. During our times in the desert he had taught me to fly, the two of us walking around the guy-roped creature theorizing on how it hung or veered in the wind.</p>
<p>When Clifton’s plane—Rupert—flew into our midst, the aging plane of Madox’s was left where it was, covered with a tarpaulin, pegged down in one of the northeast alcoves of Uweinat. Sand collected over it gradually for the next few years. None of us thought we would see it again. It was another victim of the desert. Within a few months we would pass the northeast gully and see no contour of it. By now Clifton’s plane, ten years younger, had flown into our story.</p>
<p>So you were walking towards it?</p>
<p>Yes. Four nights of walking. I had left the man in Cairo and turned back into the desert. Everywhere there was war. Suddenly there were “teams.” The Bermanns, the Bagnolds, the Slatin Pashas—who had at various times saved each other’s lives—had now split up into camps.</p>
<p>I walked towards Uweinat. I got there about noon and climbed up into the caves of the plateau. Above the well named Ain Dua.</p>
<p>“Caravaggio thinks he knows who you are,” Hana said. The man in the bed said nothing.</p>

<p>￼￼￼“He says you are not English. He worked with intelligence out of Cairo and Italy for a while. Till he was captured. My family knew Caravaggio before the war. He was a thief. He believed in ‘the movement of things.’ Some thieves are collec¬tors, like some of the explorers you scorn, like some men with women or some women with men. But Caravaggio was not like that. He was too curious and generous to be a successful thief. Half the things he stole never came home. He thinks you are not English.”</p>
<p>She watched his stillness as she spoke; it appeared that he was not listening carefully to what she was saying. Just his distant thinking. The way Duke Ellington looked and thought when he played “Solitude.”</p>
<p>She stopped talking.</p>
<p>He reached the shallow well named Ain Dua. He removed all of his clothes and soaked them in the well, put his head and then his thin body into the blue water. His limbs ex¬hausted from the four nights of walking. He left his clothes spread on the rocks and climbed up higher into the boulders, climbed out of the desert, which was now, in 1942, a vast battlefield, and went naked into the darkness of the cave.</p>
<p>He was among the familiar paintings he had found years earlier. Giraffes. Cattle. The man with his arms raised, in a plumed headdress. Several figures in the unmistakable posture of swimmers. Bermann had been right about the presence of an ancient lake. He walked farther into the coldness, into the Cave of Swimmers, where he had left her. She was still there.</p>
<p>She had dragged herself into a corner, had wrapped herself tight in the parachute material. He had promised to return for her.</p>
<p>He himself would have been happier to die in a cave, with its privacy, the swimmers caught in the rock around them. Hermann had told him that in Asian gardens you could look at rock and imagine water, you could gaze at a still pool and believe it had the hardness of rock. But she was a woman who had grown up within gardens, among moistness, with words like trellis and hedgehog. Her passion for the desert was tem¬porary. She’d come to love its sternness because of him, want¬ing to understand his comfort in its solitude. She was always happier in rain, in bathrooms steaming with liquid air, in sleepy wetness, climbing back in from his window that rainy night in Cairo and putting on her clothes while still wet, in order to hold it all. Just as she loved family traditions and courteous ceremony and old memorized poems. She would have hated to die without a name. For her there was a line back to her ancestors that was tactile, whereas he had erased the path he had emerged from. He was amazed she had loved him in spite of such qualities of anonymity in himself.</p>
