          <p>This is a story of how I fell in love with a woman, who read me a specific story from Herodotus. I heard the words she spoke across the fire, never looking up, even when she teased her husband. Perhaps she was just reading it to him. Perhaps there was no ulterior motive in the selection except for them¬selves. It was simply a story that had jarred her in its familiar¬ity of situation. But a path suddenly revealed itself in real life. Even though she had not conceived it as a first errant step in any way. I am sure.</p>
<p>“I will place you in the room where we sleep, behind the open door; and after I have gone in, my wife will also come to lie down. Now there is a seat near the entrance of the room and on this she lays her garments as she takes them off one by one; and so you will be able to gaze at her at full leisure.”</p>
<p>But Gyges is witnessed by the queen when he leaves the bedchamber. She understands then what has been done by her husband; and though ashamed, she raises no outcry… she holds her peace.</p>
<p>It is a strange story. Is it not, Caravaggio? The vanity of a man to the point where he wishes to be envied. Or he wishes to be believed, for he thinks he is not believed. This was in no way a portrait of Clifton, but he became a part of this story. There is something very shocking but human in the husband’s act. Something makes us believe it.</p>
<p>The next day the wife calls in Gyges and gives him two choices.</p>
<p>“There are now two ways open to you, and I will give you the choice which of the two you will prefer to take. Either you must slay Candaules and possess both me and the King¬dom of Lydia, or you must yourself here on the spot be slain, so that you mayest not in future, by obeying Candaules in all things, see that which you should not. Either he must die who formed this design, or you who have looked upon me naked.”</p>
<p>So the king is killed. A New Age begins. There are poems written about Gyges in iambic trimeters. He was the first of the barbarians to dedicate objects at Delphi. He reigned as King of Lydia for twenty-eight years, but we still remember him as only a cog in an unusual love story.</p>
<p>She stopped reading and looked up. Out of the quicksand. She was evolving. So power changed hands. Meanwhile, with the help of an anecdote, I fell in love.</p>
<p>Words, Caravaggio. They have a power.</p>
<p>When the Cliftons were not with us they were based in Cairo. Clifton doing other work for the English, God</p>

<p>￼￼￼knows what, an uncle in some government office. All this was before the war. But at that time the city had every nation swimming in it, meeting at Groppi’s for the soiree concerts, dancing into the night. They were a popular young couple with honour be¬tween them, and I was on the periphery of Cairo society. They lived well. A ceremonial life that I would slip into now and then. Dinners, garden parties. Events I would not normally have been interested in but now went to because she was there. I am a man who fasts until I see what I want.</p>
<p>How do I explain her to you? With the use of my hands? The way I can arc out in the air the shape of a mesa or rock? She had been part of the expedition for almost a year. I saw her, conversed with her. We had each been continually in the presence of the other. Later, when we were aware of mutual desire, these previous moments flooded back into the heart, now suggestive, that nervous grip of an arm on a cliff, looks that had been missed or misinterpreted.</p>
<p>I was at that time seldom in Cairo, there about one month in three. I worked in the Department of Egyptology on my own book, Recentes Explorations dans le Desert Libyque, as the days progressed, coming closer and closer to the text as if the desert were there somewhere on the page, so I could even smell the ink as it emerged from the fountain pen. And simul¬taneously struggled with her nearby presence, more obsessed if truth be known with her possible mouth, the tautness be¬hind the knee, the white plain of stomach, as I wrote my brief book, seventy pages long, succinct and to the point, complete with maps of travel. I was unable to remove her body from the page. I wished to dedicate the monograph to her, to her voice, to her body that I imagined rose white out of a bed like a long bow, but it was a book I dedicated to a king. Believing such an obsession would be mocked, patronized by her polite and em¬barrassed shake of the head.</p>
<p>I began to be doubly formal in her company. A characteristic of my nature. As if awkward about a previously revealed na¬kedness. It is a European habit. It was natural for me—having translated her strangely into my text of the desert—now to step into metal clothing in her presence.</p>
<p>The wild poem is a substitute</p>
<p>For the woman one loves or ought to love, One wild rhapsody a fake for another.</p>
<p>On Hassanein Bey’s lawn—the grand old man of the 1923 expedition—she walked over with the government aide Roun-dell and shook my hand, asked him to get her a drink, turned back to me and said, “I want you to ravish me.” Roundell returned. It was as if she had handed me a knife. Within a month I was her lover. In that room over the souk, north of the street of parrots.</p>
<p>I sank to my knees in the mosaic-tiled hall, my face in the curtain of her gown, the salt taste of these fingers in her mouth. We were a strange statue, the two of us, before we be¬gan to unlock our hunger. Her fingers scratching against the sand in my thinning hair. Cairo and all her deserts around us.</p>

<p>￼￼￼Was it desire for her youth, for her thin adept boyishness? Her gardens were the gardens I spoke of when I spoke to you of gardens.</p>
<p>There was that small indentation at her throat we called the Bosphorus. I would dive from her shoulder into the Bos-phorus. Rest my eye there. I would kneel while she looked down on me quizzical as if I were a planetary stranger. She of the quizzical look. Her cool hand suddenly against my neck on a Cairo bus. Taking a closed taxi and our quick-hand love between the Khedive Ismail Bridge and the Tipperary Club. Or the sun through her fingernails on the third-floor lobby at the museum when her hand covered my face.</p>
<p>As far as we were concerned there was only one person to avoid being seen by.</p>
<p>But Geoffrey Clifton was a man embedded in the English machine. He had a family genealogy going back to Canute. The machine would not necessarily have revealed to Clifton, married only eighteen months, his wife’s infidelity, but it began to encircle the fault, the disease in the system. It knew every move she and I made from the first day of the awkward touch in the porte cochere of the Semiramis Hotel.</p>
<p>I had ignored her remarks about her husband’s relatives. And Geoffrey Clifton was as innocent as we were about the great English web that was above us. But the club of body¬guards watched over her husband and kept him protected. Only Madox, who was an aristocrat with a past of regimental associations, knew about such discreet convolutions. Only Madox, with considerable tact, warned me about such a world.</p>
<p>I carried Herodotus, and Madox—a saint in his own mar¬riage—carried Anna Karenina, continually rereading the story of romance and deceit. One day, far too late to avoid the machinery we had set in motion, he tried to explain Clifton’s world in terms of Anna Karenina’s brother. Pass me my book. Listen to this.</p>
<p>Half Moscow and Petersburg were relations or friends of Oblonsky. He was born into the circle of people who were, or who became, the great ones of this earth. A third of the official world, the older men, were his father’s friends and had known him from the time he was a baby in petticoats…. Conse¬quently, the distributors of the blessings of this world were all friends of his. They could not pass over one of their own…. It was only necessary not to raise objections or be envious, not to quarrel or take offence, which in accordance with his nat¬ural kindliness he never did.</p>
<p>I have come to love the tap of your fingernail on the syringe, Caravaggio. The first time Hana gave me morphine in your company you were by the window, and at the tap of her nail your neck jerked towards us. I know a comrade. The way a lover will always recognize the camouflage of other lovers.</p>
<p>Women want everything of a lover. And too often I would sink below the surface. So armies disappear under sand. And there was her fear of her husband, her belief in her honour, my old desire for self-sufficiency, my disappearances, her sus¬picions of me, my disbelief that she loved me. The paranoia and claustrophobia of hidden love.</p>

<p>￼￼￼“I think you have become inhuman,” she said to me.</p>
<p>“I’m not the only betrayer.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you care—that this has happened among us. You slide past everything with your fear and hate of owner¬ship, of owning, of being owned, of being named. You think this is a virtue. I think you are inhuman. If I leave you, who will you go to? Would you find another lover?”</p>
<p>I said nothing. “Deny it, damn you.”</p>
<p>She had always wanted words, she loved them, grew up on them. Words gave her clarity, brought reason, shape. Whereas I thought words bent emotions like sticks in water.</p>
<p>She returned to her husband.</p>
<p>From this point on, she whispered, we will either find or lose our souls.</p>
<p>Seas move away, why not lovers? The harbours of Ephesus, the rivers of Heraclitus disappear and are replaced by estuaries of silt. The wife of Candaules becomes the wife of Gyges. Libraries burn.</p>
<p>What had our relationship been? A betrayal of those around us, or the desire of another life? She climbed back into her house beside her husband, and I retired to the zinc bars.</p>
<p>I’ll be looking at the moon,</p>
<p>but I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p>That old Herodotus classic. Humming and singing that song again and again, beating the lines thinner to bend them into one’s own life. People recover from secret loss variously. I was seen by one of her retinue sitting with a spice trader. She had once received from him a pewter thimble that held saffron. One of the ten thousand things.</p>
<p>And if Bagnold—having seen me sitting by the saffron trader—brought up the incident during dinner at the table where she sat, how did I feel about that? Did it give me some comfort that she would remember the man who had given her a small gift, a pewter thimble she hung from a thin dark chain around her neck for two days when her husband was out of town? The saffron still in it, so there was the stain of gold on her chest.</p>
<p>How did she hold this story about me, pariah to the group after some scene or other where I had disgraced</p>

<p>￼￼￼myself, Bag¬nold laughing, her husband who was a good man worrying about me, and Madox getting up and walking to a window and looking out towards the south section of the city. The conver¬sation perhaps moved to other sigh tings. They were mapmak-ers, after all. But did she climb down into the well we helped dig together and hold herself, the way I desired myself towards her with my hand?</p>
<p>We each now had our own lives, armed by the deepest treaty with the other.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she said running into me on the street. “Can’t you see you are driving us all mad.”</p>
<p>To Madox I had said I was courting a widow. But she was not a widow yet. When Madox returned to England she and I were no longer lovers. “Give my greetings to your Cairo widow,” Madox murmured. “Would’ve liked to have met her.” Did he know? I always felt more of a deceiver with him, this friend I had worked with for ten years, this man I loved more than any other man. It was 1939, and we were all leaving this country, in any case, to the war.</p>
