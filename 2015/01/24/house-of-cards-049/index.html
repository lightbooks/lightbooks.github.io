          <p>Faced with such a problem, some might have decided to fade gently from the scene and pray that their quiet retirement would not be disturbed. That was not Woolton’s style. He would rather go down fighting, and try to salvage whatever he could from the wreckage of his dreams.</p>
<p>￼He was in a determined mood by the time the press conference he had called gathered shortly after lunch. With no time to make more formal arrangements he had summoned the media to meet him on the other side of the river directly opposite the Houses of Parliament and under the shade of St Thomas’s Hospital, where the Thames and the tower of Big Ben would provide a suitably dramatic backdrop. As soon as the cameramen were ready, he began.</p>
<p>‘Good afternoon. I’ve got a short statement to make, and I’m sorry that I will not have time afterwards for questions. But I hope you will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>‘Following the ballot on Tuesday, it seems as if only three candidates have any realistic chance of success. Indeed, I understand that all the other candidates have already announced that they do not intend to stand in the second round next week. So, as you gentlemen have put it, this is a three-horse race.</p>
<p>‘Of course, I’m delighted and honoured to be one of those three, but three can be an unlucky number. There are not three real alternatives in this election, only two. Either the Party can stick to the practical approach to politics which has proved so successful and kept us in power for over a decade. Or it can develop a new raft of policies, sometimes called conscience politics, which will get Government much more deeply involved - some would say entrapped -in trying to sort out the everyday problems of individual people and families.’</p>
<p>There was a stir amongst the reporters at this sharp public acknowledgement of the division between the two wings of the Party which politicians habitually denied existed.</p>
<p>‘I don’t believe that a new emphasis on conscience politics would be appropriate - indeed, I think that however well intentioned that emphasis may be, it would in reality be a disaster for the Party and the country. I think that is also the view of the clear majority within the Party.</p>
<p>Yet paradoxically that is just the way we could end up drifting if that majority support for a pragmatic approach to politics is divided between two candidates, Mr Urquhart and myself. I am a practical man. I don’t deal in personalities but in hard-nosed politics. Because of that I believe it would be wrong for my personal ambitions to stand in the way of achieving those policies in which I believe.’</p>
<p>The cold air was condensing his breath and setting fire to his words.</p>
<p>‘So I have decided to ensure that the support for those general policies is not divided. I am withdrawing from the race. I shall be casting my own personal vote for Francis Urquhart, who I sincerely hope will be our nextPrime Minister. I have nothing more to say’</p>
<p>His last words were almost lost in the clatter of a hundred camera shutters, which continued to click as they captured the sight of Woolton striding so fast up the riverside steps towards his waiting car that he was almost running. A few gave chase, but were unable to catch him before he reached the car and was driven off across Westminster Bridge in the direction of the Foreign Office. The rest simply stood in a state of considerable bewilderment, trying to ensure that they had not only accurately recorded but also understood what Woolton had said. He had given them no time for questions, no opportunity to develop theories or surmise any hidden meaning behind his words. They had only what he had given them, and they would have to report it straight-which is precisely what Woolton intended.</p>
<p>His wife was no less confused when he returned home later that evening and they watched his dramatic announcement lead off the Nine O’clock News.</p>
<p>‘I understand why you had to back out, Patrick, and I suppose that ought to be punishment enough. I shall go on supporting you, as I always have. But why did you decide to support Urquhart, for Heaven’s sake? I never knew you were that close’</p>
<p>That superior bugger? I’m not close to him. Don’t even like him!’ Then why?’</p>
<p>‘Because I’m fifty-five and Michael Samuel is forty-eight, which means that he could be in Downing Street for twenty years until I’m dead and buried as a politician. Francis Urquhart is sixty-two, and is likely to be in office for no more than five years. So with Urquhart, there’s a chance that there will be another leadership race before I retire. In the meantime, if I can find out who is behind that tape, or they fall under a bus or get driven over by a Ministerial limousine, then I’m in with a second chance’</p>
<p>His pipe was hurling thick blue smoke into the air as he worked on his logic.</p>
<p>‘In any event, I had nothing to gain from remaining neutral. Samuel would never have tolerated me in his Cabinet. So instead I’ve handed the election to Urquhart on a plate, and he will have to show some public gratitude for that’</p>
<p>He smiled at his wife for the first time since they had heard the tape. ‘How do you fancy being the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s wife for the next couple of years?’</p>
<p>￼FRIDAY 26th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>The following morning’s weather was still well below freezing, but a new front had passed over London bringing with it crystal blue skies to replace the leaden cloud cover of the previous day. As Urquhart looked out from his Commons office across the Thames, the riverscape glowed brightly in the clear winter sunshine like a brilliant symbol of what lay ahead for him. As he gazed at the press reports of Woolton’s endorsement, he felt invulnerable, almost home.</p>
<p>Then the door burst open. It was O’Neill. Even before Urquhart could demand to know what on earth he thought he was doing, the babbling commenced. The words were fired like bullets in a battle, being hurled at Urquhart as if to overwhelm and force his submission.</p>
<p>They know, Francis. They’ve discovered that the file is missing. The locks were bent and one of the secretaries noticed and the Chairman’s called us all in. I’m sure he suspects me. What are we going to do? What are we going to do?’</p>
<p>Urquhart was shaking him to stop the incomprehensible gabble, and he was surprised at how much physical force was needed before the man was brought under some sort of control.</p>
<p>‘Roger, for God’s sake shut up!’ He pushed him bodily into a chair and the shock caused O’Neill to pause for breath. ‘Now slowly, Roger. What are you trying to say?’</p>
<p>The files. The confidential party files on Samuel you asked me to send to the Sunday newspapers.’ He was panting for breath from physical and nervous exhaustion. ‘Well, I was able to use my pass key to get into the basement storage room without any trouble, but the files are all in locked cabinets. I had to force the lock, Francis. I’m sorry but I had no choice. Not very much but it bent a little. There’s so much dust and cobwebs around that it looked as if no one had been in there since the Boer War, but yesterday some bitch of a secretary decided to go in there and noticed the bent lock. Now they’ve gone through the whole lot and discovered that Samuel’s file is missing.’</p>
<p>You sent them the original file? You didn’t just copy the interesting bits as I told you?’</p>
<p>‘Francis, the file was very thick, it would have taken hours to copy. I didn’t know which bits they would be most interested in, so I sent them the lot. It could have been years before anyone noticed the file was missing, and then they would have thought it was simply misplaced.’</p>
<p>‘You bloody fool, you…’</p>
<p>‘Francis, don’t shout at me!’ O’Neill screamed. It’s me who’s taken all the risks, not you. The Chairman’s personally interrogating everyone with a pass key and there are only nine of us. He’s asked to see me this afternoon. I’m sure he suspects me. And I’m not going to take the blame all on my own. Why should I? I only did what you told me… Francis, I can’t go on lying. I simply can’t stand it any more. I’ll go to pieces!’</p>
<p>Urquhart froze as he realised the truth behind O’Neill’s desperate words. This quivering man in front of him had no resistance or judgement left; he was beginning to crumble and flake like some old, brittle newspaper. The eyes were flickering furiously once more as the words tumbled out, and Urquhart realised that not even for a week, not even for this week, could O’Neill control himself. He was on the very edge. The slightest wind could send him hurtling down towards destruction. And he would take Urquhart with him.</p>
<p>‘Roger, you are over-anxious. You have nothing to fear, no one can prove anything and you must remember that I’m on your side. You are not alone in this. Look, don’t go back to the office, call in sick and go home. The Chairman can wait till Monday. And tomorrow I would like you to come and be my house guest in Hampshire. Come for lunch and stay overnight while we talk the whole thing through - together, just the two of us’</p>
<p>O’Neill gripped Urquhart’s hand in delight and relief, like a cripple flingingto his crutch.</p>
<p>‘But don’t tell anyone that you are corning to visit me. It would be very embarrassing if the press were to find out that a senior party official is my house guest just before the final leadership ballot - it wouldn’t look right for either of us - so this must be strictly between the two of us. Not even your secretary must know’</p>
<p>O’Neill tried to mutter a word of thanks but was cut short by three enormous sneezes which had Urquhart reeling in disgust. O’Neill didn’t seem to notice as he wiped his face and smiled with the new found eagerness of a spaniel.</p>
<p>I’ll be there, Francis. I’ll be there.’</p>
<p>￼SATURDAY 27th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>Urquhart got up before dawn. He hadn’t slept, but was not in the least tired. He knew this was to be a very special day. Well before the early light of morning was breaking above the New Forest moors, he dressed in his favourite hunting jacket, pulled on his boots and strode out into the freezing morning air along the bridle path which led across Emery Down towards Lyndhurst. The ground mist clung closely to the hedgerows, discouraging the birds and damping down all sound. It pressed around him like a cocoon and he was utterly alone, a man on an empty planet who must make his own decisions and decide his own fate.</p>
<p>He had walked nearly three miles before he began a long, slow climb up the southern face of a hill, and slowly the fog began to clear as the rising sun cut through the damp air. He had just emerged from a bank of swirling mist when he saw the stag across the patch of sun-cleared hillside, browsing amongst the damp gorse. He slipped gently behind a low bush, waiting, like a hunter for his prey. But he was not a complete hunter. He had never hunted a man. He had been too young for Hitler, too busy at university for Korea, too late for Suez. He had never known what it was like to exchange another man’s life for his own, to condemn someone before they had the chance to do the same to you.</p>
<p>He wondered how his brother had died. He imagined him in a shallow dugout underneath a Dunkirk hedgerow, waiting for the barrel of the first German tank to appear over the brow of the hill. As he lay there ready to kill, to destroy as many other lives as possible, had he felt exhilarated like some savage animal by the chance to shed blood? Had he been immobilised by terror, a man turned rabbit by panic in spite of his training and sense of duty? Or had he felt a calming certainty about the need for. self-preservation which had overcome all apprehension and a lifetime of Sunday School morality - just as Urquhart felt now?</p>
