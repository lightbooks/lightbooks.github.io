<p>THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</p>
<p>WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES EDITED BY CHARLES W. ELIOT, L.L.D.,</p>
<p>P. F. COLLIER &amp; SON COMPANY, NEW YORK (1909)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in Milk Street, Boston, on January 6, 1706. His father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler who married twice, and of his seventeen children Benjamin was the youngest son. His schooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who published the “New England Courant.” To this journal he became a contributor, and later was for a time its nominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjamin ran away, going first to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, where he arrived in October, 1723. He soon ob- tained work as a printer, but after a few months he was induced by Gov- ernor Keith to go to London, where, finding Keith’s promises empty, he again worked as a compositor till he was brought back to Philadelphia by a merchant named Denman, who gave him a position in his business. On Denman’s death he returned to his former trade, and shortly set up a printing house of his own from which he published “The Pennsylvania Gazette,” to which he contributed many essays, and which he made a medium for agitating a variety of local reforms. In 1732 he began to issue his famous “Poor Richard’s Almanac” for the enrichment of which he borrowed or composed those pithy utterances of worldly wisdom which are the basis of a large part of his popular reputation. In 1758, the year in which he ceases writing for the Almanac, he printed in it “Father Abraham’s Sermon,” now regarded as the most famous piece of literature produced in Colonial America.</p>

<p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Meantime Franklin was concerning himself more and more with pub- lic affairs. He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which was taken up later and finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania; and he founded an “American Philosophical Society” for the purpose of enabling scientific men to communicate their discoveries to one another. He him- self had already begun his electrical researches, which, with other scien- tific inquiries, he called on in the intervals of money-making and politics to the end of his life. In 1748 he sold his business in order to get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the learned through- out Europe. In politics he proved very able both as an administrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an office-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance his relatives. His most notable service in home politics was his reform of the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his services in connection with the relations of the Colonies with Great Britain, and later with France. In 1757 he was sent to England to protest against the influence of the Penns in the gov- ernment of the colony, and for five years he remained there, striving to enlighten the people and the ministry of England as to Colonial condi- tions. On his return to America he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair, through which he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was again despatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to petition the King to resume the government from the hands of the proprietors. In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but lost the credit for this and much of his popularity through his securing for a friend the office of stamp agent in America. Even his effective work in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him still a suspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for the Colonies as the troubles thickened to- ward the crisis of the Revolution. In 1767 he crossed to France, where he was received with honor; but before his return home in 1775 he lost his position as postmaster through his share in divulging to Massachusetts the famous letter of Hutchinson and Oliver. On his arrival in Philadel- phia he was chosen a member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 he was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States. Here he remained till 1785, the favorite of French society; and with such suc- cess did he conduct the affairs of his country that when he finally re- turned he received a place only second to that of Washington as the cham- pion of American independence. He died on April 17, 1790.</p>
<p>The first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed in En- gland in 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at which date he</p>

<p>brought it down to 1757. After a most extraordinary series of adventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printed by Mr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of its value as a picture of one of the most notable personalities of Colonial times, and of its ac- knowledged rank as one of the great autobiographies of the world.</p>

<p>The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop, as Dr. Franklin used to style him.—B.</p>
<p>DEAR SON: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the re- mains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the jour- ney I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to* you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week’s uninter- rupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.</p>
<p>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repeti- tion of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages au- thors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one’s life over again seems to be a recollec- tion of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the words “agreeable to” the words “some of ” were interlined and afterward effaced.—B.</li>
</ul>

<p>￼The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might con- ceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, “Without vanity I may say,” &amp;c., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.</p>
<p>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to ac- knowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them suc- cess. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may expe- rience as others have done: the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflic- tions.</p>
<p>The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith’s business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in</p>
