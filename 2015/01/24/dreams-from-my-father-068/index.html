          <p>“What about Yusuf?” Auma asked. “Couldn’t he do more?”</p>
<p>Sayid shook his head. “My brother, he talks like a book, but I’m afraid he does not like to lead by example.”</p>
<p>Auma turned to me. “You know, Yusuf was doing really well for a time. He did well in school, didn’t he, Sayid? He</p>
<p>received several good job offers. Then, I don’t know what happened. He just dropped out. Now he just stays here with Granny, doing small chores for her. It’s as if he’s afraid to try to succeed.”</p>
<p>Sayid nodded. “I think perhaps education doesn’t do us much good unless it is mixed with sweat.”</p>
<p>I thought about what Sayid had said as we continued to walk. Perhaps he was right; perhaps the idea of poverty had been imported to this place, a new standard of need and want that was carried like measles, by me, by Auma, by Yusuf’s archaic radio. To say that poverty was just an idea wasn’t to say that it wasn’t real; the people we’d just met couldn’t ignore the fact that some people had indoor toilets or ate meat every day, any more than the children of Altgeld could ignore the fast cars and lavish homes that flashed across their television sets.</p>
<p>But perhaps they could fight off the notion of their own helplessness. Sayid was telling us about his own life now: his disappointment at having never gone to the university, like his older brothers, for lack of funds; his work in the National Youth Corps, assigned to development projects around the country, a three-year stint that was now coming to an end. He had spent his last two holidays knocking on the doors of various businesses in Nairobi, so far without any success. Still, he seemed undaunted by his circumstances, certain that persistence would eventually pay off.</p>
<p>“To get a job these days, even as a clerk, requires that you know somebody,” Sayid said as we approached Granny’s compound. “Or you must grease the palm of some person very heavily. That’s why I would like to start my own business. Something small only. But mine. That was your father’s error, I think. For all his brilliance, he never had something of his own.” He thought for a moment. “Of course, there’s no point wasting time worrying about the mistakes of the past, am I correct? Like this dispute over your father’s inheritance. From the beginning, I have told my sisters to forget this thing. We must get on with our lives. They do not listen to me, though. And in the meantime, the money they fight over goes where? To the lawyers. The lawyers are eating very well off this case, I believe. How does the saying go? When two locusts fight, it is always the crow who feasts.”</p>
<p>“Is that a Luo expression?” I asked. Sayid’s face broke into a bashful smile.</p>
<p>“We have similar expressions in Luo,” he said, “but actually I must admit that I read this particular expression in a book by Chinua Achebe. The Nigerian writer. I like his books very much. He speaks the truth about Africa’s predicament. The Nigerian, the Kenyan-it is the same. We share more than divides us.”</p>
<p>Granny and Roy were sitting outside the house and talking to a man in a heavy suit when we returned. The man turned out to be the principal of the nearby school, and he had stopped to share news from town and enjoy the chicken stew left over from the night before. I noticed that Roy had his bag packed, and asked him where he was going.</p>
<p>“To Kendu Bay,” he said. “The principal here is going that way, so myself, Bernard, and my mum, we’re going to go catch a ride with him and bring Abo back here. You should come, too, and pay your respects to the family there.”</p>
<p>Auma decided to stay back with Granny, but Sayid and I went to gather a change of clothes and piled into the principal’s old jalopy. The drive to Kendu turned out to be several hours long by the main highway; to the west, Lake Victoria appeared intermittently, its still, silver waters tapering off into flat green marsh. By late afternoon we were pulling down Kendu Bay’s main street, a wide, dusty road lined with sand-colored shops. After thanking the principal, we caught a matatu down a maze of side streets, until all signs of town had disappeared and the landscape was once again open pasture and cornfields. At a fork in the road, Kezia signaled for us to get off, and we began walking along a deep, chalk-colored gully at the bottom of which flowed a wide, chocolate-brown river. Along the riverbank, we could see women slapping wet clothes against exposed rock; on a terrace above, a herd of goats chewed on the patches of</p>
<p>yellow grass, their black, white, and roan markings like lichen against the earth. We turned down a narrower footpath and came to the entrance of a hedged-in compound. Kezia stopped and pointed to what looked like a random pile of rocks and sticks, saying something to Roy in Luo.</p>
<p>“That’s Obama’s grave,” Roy explained. “Our great-grandfather. All the land around here is called K’Obama-‘Land of the Obama.’ We are Jok’Obama-‘the people of Obama.’ Our great-great-grandfather was raised in Alego, but he moved here when he was still a young man. This is where Obama settled, and where all his children were born.”</p>
<p>“So why did our grandfather go back to Alego?”</p>
<p>Roy turned to Kezia, who shook her head. “You have to ask Granny that question,” Roy said. “My mum thinks maybe he didn’t get along with his brothers. In fact, one of his brothers is still living here. He’s old now, but perhaps we can see him.”</p>
<p>We came to a small wooden house where a tall, handsome woman was sweeping the yard. Behind her, a young shirtless man sat on the porch. The woman shaded her eyes with her forearm and began to wave, and the young man slowly turned our way. Roy went up to shake hands with the woman, whose name was Salina, and the young man stood up to greet us.</p>
<p>“Eh, you people finally came for me,” Abo said, hugging each of us in turn. He reached for his shirt. “I had heard you were coming with Barry so long ago!”</p>
<p>“Yah, you know how it is,” Roy said. “It took us a while to get organized.”</p>
<p>“I’m just glad you came. I’m telling you, I need to get back to Nairobi.”</p>
<p>“You don’t like it here, eh?”</p>
<p>“It’s so boring, man, you would not believe it. No TV. No clubs. These people in the country, I think they are slow. If</p>
<p>Billy hadn’t shown up, I would have gone crazy for sure.”</p>
<p>“Billy’s here?”</p>
<p>“Yah, he’s around somewhere….” Abo waved his hand vaguely, then turned to me and smiled. “So, Barry. What have</p>
<p>you brought me from America?”</p>
<p>I reached into my bag and pulled out one of the portable cassette players that I had bought for him and Bernard. He</p>
<p>turned it over in his hands with a thinly disguised look of disappointment.</p>
<p>“This brand is not a Sony, is it?” he said. Then, looking up, he quickly recovered himself and slapped me on the back.</p>
<p>“That’s okay, Barry. Thank you! Thank you.”</p>
<p>I nodded at him, trying not to get angry. He was standing beside Bernard and their resemblance was striking: the same</p>
<p>height, the same slender frame, the same smooth, even features. Just shave off Abo’s mustache, I thought to myself, and they could almost Pass as twins. Except for…what? The look in Abo’s eyes. That was it. Not just the telltale redness of some sort of high but something deeper, something that reminded me of young men back in Chicago. An element of guardedness, perhaps, and calculation. The look of someone who realizes early in life that he has been wronged.</p>
<p>We followed Salina inside the house, and she brought in a tray of sodas and biscuits. As she set down the tray, a strapping, mustached young man, as good-looking as Salina and as tall as Roy, walked through the door and let out a yell.</p>
<p>“Roy! What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Roy stood up and they embraced. “You know me. Just looking for a meal. I should ask you the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Me, I am only visiting my mother. If I don’t come so often, she begins to complain.” He kissed Salina on the cheek</p>
<p>and took my hand in a crushing handshake. “So I see you’ve brought my American cousin! I’ve heard so much about you, Barry, I cannot believe you are now here.” He turned to Salina. “Have you given Barry food?”</p>
<p>“Soon, Billy. Soon.” Salina took Kezia’s hand and turned to Roy. “You see what mothers must put up with? How is your granny, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Same.”</p>
<p>She nodded thoughtfully. “That is not so bad,” she said.</p>
<p>Together with Kezia, she went out of the room, and Billy fell onto the couch beside Roy.</p>
<p>“So, you still crazy, bwana? Look at you now! Well-fed, like a prize bull! You must be enjoying yourself in the</p>
<p>States.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Roy said. “How’s Mombasa? I hear you’re working at the post office.”</p>
<p>Billy shrugged. “The pay is all right. Not too much thinking, you know, but steady.” He turned to me. “Let me tell</p>
<p>you, Barry, this brother of yours, he was wild! Truthfully, we were all wild back then. We spent most of our time chasing the bush meat, eh Roy!” He slapped Roy on the thigh and laughed. “So tell me, how are these American women?”</p>
<p>Roy laughed, but he seemed relieved when Salina and Kezia brought in dinner. “You see, Barry,” Billy said, setting down his plate on the low table in front of him, “your father and my father were age-mates. Very close. When Roy and I were growing up, we were also age-mates, so naturally we became very close. Let me tell you, your father, he was a very great man. I was closer to him than to my own father. If I was in trouble, it was my Uncle Barack that I went to first. And Roy, you would also go to my father, I believe.”</p>
<p>“The men in our family were very good to other people’s children,” Roy said quietly. “With their own, they didn’t want to look weak.”</p>
<p>Billy nodded and licked his fingers. “You know, Roy, I think there’s truth in what you say. Myself, I don’t want to make the same mistakes. I don’t want to mistreat my family.” With his clean hand, Billy pulled his wallet out of his pocket and showed me a picture of his wife and their two young children. “I swear, bwana, marriage takes you! You should see me now, Roy. I’ve become so calm. A family man. Of course, there are limits to what a man should take. My wife, she knows not to cross me too often. What do you say, Sayid?”</p>
<p>I realized that Sayid hadn’t spoken much since we arrived. He washed his hands now before turning to Billy.</p>
<p>“I am not yet married,” he said, “so perhaps I should not speak. But I admit, I have been giving these matters some thought. I have concluded that the problem that is most serious for Africa is what?” He paused to look around the room. “This thing between men and women. Our men, we try to be strong, but our strength is often misplaced. Like this business with having more than one woman. Our fathers had many wives, so we also must have many women. But we do not stop and look at the consequences. What happens with all these women? They become jealous. The children, they are not close to their fathers. It is-”</p>
<p>Sayid caught himself suddenly and smiled. “Of course, I have not even one wife, so I shouldn’t carry on so. Where there is no experience, I believe the wise man is silent.”</p>
<p>“Achebe?” I asked.</p>
<p>Sayid laughed and clutched my hand. “No, Barry. That one was only me.”</p>
<p>It was dark by the time we finished dinner, and, after thanking Salina and Kezia for the food, we followed Billy</p>
<p>outside onto a narrow footpath. Walking under a full moon, we soon came to a smaller house where the shadows of moths fluttered against a yellow window. Billy knocked on the door, and a short man with a scar along his forehead answered, his lips smiling but his eyes darting around like those of a man about to be struck. Behind him sat another man, tall, very thin, dressed in white and with a wispy goatee and mustache that made him look like an Indian sadhu. Together, the two men began shaking our hands feverishly, speaking to me in broken English.</p>
