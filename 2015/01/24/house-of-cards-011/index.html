          <p>‘And let me assure you, Roger, that I know precisely what you have been spending the money on,’ he said quietly.</p>
<p>He took a sip from his cognac as his victim remained motionless, transfixed. ‘Roger, as Chief Whip I have to become familiar with every problem known to man. Do you know, in the last two years I have had to deal with cases of wife beating, adultery, fraud, mental illness. I’ve even had a case of incest. We didn’t let him stand for re-election, of course, but there was nothing to be gained by making a public fuss about such things. That’s why you almost never hear about them, incest I draw the line at but in general we don’t moralise, Roger. Every man is allowed one weakness or indulgence - so long as it remains a private one’</p>
<p>He paused. In fact, one of my Junior Whips is a doctor who was appointed specifically to help me spot the signs of strain, and we get quite practised at it After all, we have well over 300 MPs to look after, all of whom are living on the edge and under immense pressure. You’d be surprised, too, how many cases of drug abuse we get at Westminster. The specialists say there is something like 10 per cent of the population, including MPs, who are physiologically or psychologically vulnerable to chemical addiction of one sort or another. Not their fault, it’s something in their makeup, and they have much more trouble than the rest of us in resisting drink, pills and the rest. There’s a charming and utterly private drying- out farm just outside Dover where we send them, sometimes for a couple of months. Most of them recover completely and return to a full political life.’</p>
<p>He paused yet again to swill the cognac around his glass and sip it gently, but continued to watch O’Neill closely. The other man did not stir. He sat there as if petrified.</p>
<p>‘But it helps to catch them early,’ Urquhart continued, ‘which is why we are so sensitive to the signs of drug abuse. Like cocaine. It’s become a real problem recently. They tell me it’s fashionable - whatever that means - and too damned easy to obtain. Do you know it can rot your nasal membranes clean away if you let it? Funny drug. Gives people an instant high and persuades them that their brain and senses can complete five hours’ work in just five minutes. Makes a good man brilliant, so they say. Pity it’s so addictive’</p>
<p>There was another pause. ‘And expensive’</p>
<p>Urquhart had not taken his eyes off O’Neill for a second during his narrative, and had witnessed the exquisite agony which had racked O’Neill inside. Any doubt about his diagnosis that he had started with had been brushed aside with the whimpering which began slowly to emerge from the other man. Now his words were tortured and pleading.</p>
<p>‘What are you saying? I am not a drug addict. I don’t do drugs!’</p>
<p>‘No, of course not, Roger.’ Urquhart adopted his most reassuring tone. ‘But I think you must accept that there are some people who could jump to the most unfortunate conclusions about you. And the Prime Minister, you know, is not a man to take chances. It’s not a matter of condemning a man without trial, simply opting for a quiet life without unnecessary risks.’</p>
<p>The Prime Minister can’t believe this!’ O’Neill gasped as if he had been butted by a charging bull.</p>
<p>I’m afraid that the Chairman was a little less than helpful with the PM the other day - he knows nothing, of course, but I don’t think the dear Lord Williams is one of your greatest fans. Don’t worry, I reassured the Prime Minister about you, and you have nothing to fear. As long as you have my support.’</p>
<p>Urquhart knew full well of the paranoia which dominates the minds of cocaine addicts, and the impact which his totally invented story about the Chairman’s disaffection would leave on O’Neill’s helter-skelter emotions. He also knew that the paranoia was matched by a lust for notoriety, which O’Neill could only achieve through his political connections and the continued patronage of the Prime Minister, and this he could not bear to lose. ‘As long as you have my support’ rang in O’Neill’s ears. ‘One slip and you are dead’ it was saying. The web around O’Neill was complete, and now Urquhart offered him the way out.</p>
<p>‘You see, Roger, I have seen gossip destroy so many men. Gossip founded on no more than circumstantial evidence or even naked jealousy, perhaps, but you know that the corridors around Westminster have been killing fields for less fortunate people than you or me. It would be a tragedy if you were pilloried either because of Lord Williams’ hostility towards you or because people misunderstood your arrangement about expenses</p>
<p>and your - hay fever.’</p>
<p>‘What should I do?’ The voice was plaintive.</p>
<p>‘Your position is a delicate one, particularly at a time when the political currents within the Government are ebbing and flowing. I would suggest that you trust me. You need a strong supporter in the inner circles of the Party, particularly as the Prime Minister appears to be getting into more difficult waters and will be concentrating on rescuing himself rather than spending his time rescuing others.’</p>
<p>He paused to watch O’Neill writhe in his chair. ‘I would suggest the following. I shall tell the agency I have fully established that your expenses are legitimate. I shall ask them to continue with the arrangement, on the basis that we are doing it this way to avoid unhelpful jealousy from some of your colleagues within party headquarters who do not support extensive advertising budgets and who might use your high but perfectly legitimate</p>
<p>￼expenses to attack the whole communications set-up. The agency can regard it as a sensible insurance policy. Also, I shall ensure that the Prime Minister continues to be fully informed of the good work you are doing for the Party. I shall certainly try to persuade him of the need to continue a high level publicity campaign to get him through the difficult months ahead, so that your budget is not cut to shreds by the Chairman.’</p>
<p>‘You know I would be most grateful…’ O’Neill mumbled.</p>
<p>In return, you will keep me informed of eveiything that is going on at party headquarters and in particular what the Chairman is up to. He’s a very ambitious and dangerous man, you know. Playing his own game while professing loyalty to the Prime Minister. Between us, though, I think we can ensure that no harm is done to the Prime Minister’s - or to your - interests. You must be my eyes and ears, Roger, and you will have to let me know immediately of anything you hear of the Chairman’s plans. Your future could depend upon it.’ He punched home the words to let O’Neill be in no doubt that he meant it.</p>
<p>‘We must work together on this. You will have to help me. I know how much you love politics and the Party, and I think the two of us together can help steer the Party through some difficult times ahead.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you,’ O’Neill whispered.</p>
<p>￼WEDNESDAY 30th JUNE</p>
<p>The Strangers Bar in the House of Commons is a small, dark room overlooking the Thames where Members of Parliament may take their ‘Stranger’ or non-Member guests. As a result it is usually crowded and noisy with rumour and gossip. Tonight was no exception as O’Neill propped up the bar with one elbow and struggled valiantly with the other to avoid knocking the drink out of his host’s hand.</p>
<p>‘Another one, Steve?’ he asked of his immaculately dressed companion.</p>
<p>Stephen Kendrick looked somewhat out of place in his light grey Armani mohair suit, pearl white cuffs and immaculately manicured hands clasped around a glass of Federation bitter, a draught beer for which the bars of the Palace of Westminster afford a warm home.</p>
<p>‘Now you know better than me that Strangers can’t buy drinks here. And anyway, I’ve only been here two weeks and I wouldn’t want to ruin my career by having anyone see the Prime Minister’s pet Irish wolfhound forcing drinks down the Opposition’s newest and fastest rising backbencher. Some of my more dogmatic colleagues would treat that as treachery!’</p>
<p>He grinned and winked at the barmaid to attract her attention. Another pint of dark bitter and a double vodka-tonic were quick in coming.</p>
<p>‘You know, Rog, I’m still pinching myself. I never really expected to get here, and I still can’t decide whether it’s a dream or just a bloody awful nightmare. When we worked together at the same little PR shop seven years ago, who would have guessed you would now be the chief grunter for the Prime Minister and I would be a humble if wonderfully talented Opposition MP?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not that little blonde telephonist we used to take turns with’ ribbed O’Neill. They both chuckled at the memory of younger and more frivolous days.</p>
<p>‘Dear little Annie’ mused Kendrick.</p>
<p>‘I thought her name was Jennie’ protested O’Neill.</p>
<p>‘Rog, in those days I never remember you being fussy about what they were called.’</p>
<p>The banter finally broke the ice between the two men which had been slowly thawing with the drink. When O’Neill had telephoned the new MP to suggest a drink for old times’ sake, they had both found it difficult to revive the easy familiarity which they had known in earlier years. They had been careful, perhaps too careful, to avoid the subject of politics which now dominated both their lives and it had forced their conversation along artificial lines. Now O’Neill decided to take the plunge.</p>
<p>‘Steve, I don’t mind you buying the drinks all night as far as I’m concerned. The way my masters are going at the moment, I think a saint would be driven to drink.’</p>
<p>Kendrick accepted the opening. Tour lot do seem to be getting their robes of office in something of a twist. There are all sorts of weird rumours going round this place about how Samuel is furious with Williams for putting his head on the block with the PM, Williams is furious with Collingridge for screwing up the election campaign, and Collingridge is furious with just about everyone.’</p>
<p>‘Maybe it’s simply that they are all tired after the election and can’t wait to get away on holiday’ O’Neill responded. ‘Like an irritable family squabbling about how the car is packed before taking a long trip.’</p>
<p>If you don’t mind me saying, old chum, I think your leader is going to have to put an end to all the bickering very quickly, or else hell go into the Summer Recess with the family looking more like a pack of Westminster alley cats. No Prime Minister can afford to let those sort of rumours run away from him, otherwise they begin to gain a life of their own. They become reality. Still, that’s where you and your vast publicity budgets come to the rescue, like the Seventh Cavalry over the hill.’</p>
<p>‘More like Custer’s last bloody stand’ O’Neill said with some bitterness.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter, Rog, Uncle Teddy run off with all your toy soldiers or something?’ Kendrick asked with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>O’Neill emptied his glass and Kendrick ordered another round.</p>
<p>‘Between you and me, just as old chums, Steve, he’s run off with almost all of them. Hell, we need to find new friends more than ever, but instead of going onto the offensive the Chairman seems content to retreat behind the barricades’</p>
<p>‘Ah, do I detect the cries of a frustrated Publicity Director who has been told to shut up shop for a while?’</p>
<p>O’Neill banged the bar in exasperation. ‘I shouldn’t tell you this, I suppose, but as it’s not going to happen there’s no harm. The new hospital expansion programme which we promised at the election giving matching Government funds for any money raised locally. We had a wonderful promotional campaign, all ready to go throughout the summer while all you bastards were off on the Costa del Cuba or wherever it is you go’</p>
