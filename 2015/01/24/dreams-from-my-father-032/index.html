          <p>“We’re quitting,” Angela said.</p>
<p>“Who’s quitting?”</p>
<p>Angela shrugged. “Well…I am, I guess. I can’t speak for everybody else.”</p>
<p>I looked around the room. The other leaders averted their eyes, like a jury that’s delivered an unfavorable verdict. “I’m sorry, Barack,” Angela continued. “It has nothing to do with you. The truth is, we’re just tired. We’ve all been at</p>
<p>this for two years, and we’ve got nothing to show for it.”</p>
<p>“I understand you’re frustrated, Angela. We’re all a little frustrated. But you need to give it more time. We-” “We don’t have more time,” Shirley broke in. “We can’t keep on making promises to our people, and then have</p>
<p>nothing happen. We need something now.”</p>
<p>I fidgeted with my coffee cup, trying to think of something else to say. Words jumbled up in my head, and for a</p>
<p>moment I was gripped with panic. Then the panic gave way to anger. Anger at Marty for talking me into coming to Chicago. Anger at the leaders for being short-sighted. Anger at myself for believing I could have ever bridged the gap between them. I suddenly remembered what Frank had told me that night back in Hawaii, after I had heard that Toot was scared of a black man.</p>
<p>That’s the way it is, he had said. You might as well get used to it.</p>
<p>In this peevish mood, I looked out the window and saw a group of young boys gathered across the street. They were tossing stones at the boarded-up window of a vacant apartment, their hoods pulled over their heads like miniature monks. One of the boys reached up and started yanking at a loose piece of plywood nailed across the apartment door, then stumbled and fell, causing the others to laugh. A part of me suddenly felt like joining them, tearing apart the whole dying landscape, piece by piece. Instead, I turned back toward Angela.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you something,” I said, pointing out the window. “What do you suppose is going to happen to those boys out there?”</p>
<p>“Barack…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just asking you a question. You say you’re tired, the same way most folks out here are tired. So I’m just trying to figure out what’s going to happen to those boys. Who’s going to make sure they get a fair shot? The alderman? The social workers? The gangs?”</p>
<p>I could hear my voice rising, but I didn’t let up. “You know, I didn’t come here ’cause I needed a job. I came here ’cause Marty said there were some people who were serious about doing something to change their neighborhoods. I don’t care what’s happened in the past. I know that I’m here, and committed to working with you. If there’s a problem, then we’ll fix it. If you don’t think anything’s happened after working with me, then I’ll be the first one to tell you to quit. But if you all are planning to quit now, then I want you to answer my question.”</p>
<p>I stopped there, trying to read each of their faces. They seemed surprised at my outburst, though none of them was as surprised as me. I knew I was on precarious ground; I wasn’t close enough to any of them to be sure my play wouldn’t backfire. At that particular moment, though, I had no other hand to play. The boys outside moved on down the street. Shirley went to get herself more coffee. After what seemed like ten minutes, Will finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about the rest of you, but I think we’ve talked about this same old mess long enough. Marty knows we got problems. That’s why he hired Barack. Ain’t that right, Barack?”</p>
<p>I nodded cautiously.</p>
<p>“Things still bad out here. Ain’t nothing gone away. So what I wanna know,” he said, turning to me, “is what we gonna do from here on out.”</p>
<p>I told him the truth. “I don’t know, Will. You tell me.”</p>
<p>Will smiled, and I sensed that the immediate crisis had passed. Angela agreed to give it another few months. I agreed to concentrate more time on Altgeld. We spent the next half hour talking strategy and handing out assignments. On our way out, Mona came up and took me by the arm.</p>
<p>“You handled that meeting pretty good, Barack. Seems like you know what you’re doing.” “I don’t, Mona. I don’t have a clue.”</p>
<p>She laughed. “Well, I promise I won’t tell nobody.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that, Mona. I sure do appreciate that.”</p>
<p>That evening, I called Marty and told him some of what had happened. He wasn’t surprised: several of the suburban churches were already starting to drop out. He gave me a few suggestions for approaching the job issue in Altgeld, then advised me to pick up the pace of my interviews.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need to find some new leaders, Barack. I mean, Will’s a terrific guy and all that, but do you really want to depend on him to keep the organization afloat?”</p>
<p>I understood Marty’s point. As much as I liked Will, as much as I appreciated his support, I had to admit that some of his ideas were…well, eccentric. He liked to smoke reefer at the end of a day’s work (“If God didn’t want us to smoke the stuff, he wouldn’t have put it on this here earth”). He would walk out of any meeting that he decided was boring. Whenever I took him along to interview members of his church, he’d start arguing with them about their incorrect</p>
<p>reading of Scripture, their choice of lawn fertilizer, or the constitutionality of the income tax (he felt that tax violated the Bill of Rights, and conscientiously refused to pay).</p>
<p>“Maybe if you listened to other people a little more,” I had told him once, “they’d be more responsive.”</p>
<p>Will had shaken his head. “I do listen. That’s the problem. Everything they say is wrong.”</p>
<p>Now, after the meeting in Altgeld, Will had a new idea. “These mixed-up Negroes inside St. Catherine’s ain’t never</p>
<p>gonna do nothing,” he said. “If we wanna get something done, we gonna have to take it to the streets!” He pointed out that many of the people who lived in the immediate vicinity of St. Catherine’s were jobless and struggling; those were the people we should be targeting, he said. And because they might not feel comfortable attending a meeting hosted by a foreign church, we should conduct a series of street corner meetings around West Pullman, allowing them to gather on neutral turf.</p>
<p>I was skeptical at first, but unwilling as I was to discourage any initiative, I helped Will and Mary prepare a flyer, for distribution along the block closest to the church. A week later, the three of us stood out on the corner in the late autumn wind. The street remained empty at first, the shades drawn down the rows of brick bungalows. Then, slowly, people began to emerge, one or two at a time, women in hair nets, men in flannel shirts or windbreakers, shuffling through the brittle gold leaves, edging toward the growing circle. When the gathering numbered twenty or so, Will explained that St. Catherine’s was part of a larger organizing effort and that “we want you to talk to your neighbors about all the things y’all complain about when you’re sitting at the kitchen table.”</p>
<p>“Well, all I can say is, it’s about time,” one woman said.</p>
<p>For almost an hour, people talked about potholes and sewers, stop signs and abandoned lots. As the afternoon fell to dusk, Will announced that we’d be moving the meetings to St. Catherine’s basement starting the following month. Walking back to the church, I heard the crowd still behind us, a murmur in the fading light. Will turned to me and smiled.</p>
<p>“Told you.”</p>
<p>We repeated these street corner meetings on three, four, five blocks-Will at the center with his priest’s collar and Chicago Cubs jacket, Mary with her sign-in sheets circling the edges of the crowd. By the time we moved the meetings indoors, we had a group of close to thirty people, prepared to work for little more than a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>It was before such a meeting that I found Mary alone in the church hall, making a pot of coffee. The evening’s agenda was neatly printed on a sheet of butcher’s paper taped to the wall; the chairs were all set up. Mary waved at me while searching a cupboard for sugar and creamer, and told me Will was running a little late.</p>
<p>“Need any help?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“Can you reach this?”</p>
<p>I pulled down the sugar from the top shelf. “Anything else?”</p>
<p>“No. I think we’re all set.”</p>
<p>I took a seat and watched Mary finish arranging the cups. She was a hard person to know, Mary was; she didn’t like to</p>
<p>talk much, about herself or her past. I knew that she was the only white person from the city who worked with us, one of maybe five white people left in West Pullman. I knew that she had two daughters, one ten and one twelve; the younger one had a disability that made walking difficult and required regular therapy.</p>
<p>And I knew that the father was absent, although Mary never mentioned him. Only in bits and pieces, over the course of many months, would I learn that she had grown up in a small Indiana town, part of a big, working-class Irish family. Somehow she had met a black man there; they had dated secretly, were married; her family refused to speak to her again, and the newlyweds moved to West Pullman, where they bought a small house. Then the man left, and Mary found herself beached in a world she knew little of, without anything but the house and two manila-hued daughters, unable to return to the world she had known.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would stop by Mary’s house just to say hello, drawn perhaps by the loneliness I sensed there, and the easy parallels between my own mother and Mary; and between myself and Mary’s daughters, such sweet and pretty girls whose lives were so much more difficult than mine had ever been, with grandparents who shunned them, black classmates who teased them, all the poison in the air. Not that the family had no support; after Mary’s husband left, the neighbors had shown her and her children solicitude, helping them fix a leaky roof, inviting them to barbecues and birthday parties, commending Mary on all her good works. Still, there were limits to how far the neighbors could accept the family, unspoken boundaries to the friendships that Mary could make with the women-specially the married ones-that she met. Her only real friends were her daughters-and now Will, whose own fall, and idiosyncratic faith, gave them something private to share.</p>
<p>With nothing left to do for the meeting, Mary sat down and watched me scribble some last-minute notes to myself. “Do you mind if I ask you something, Barack?”</p>
<p>“No, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Why are you here? Doing this work, I mean.”</p>
<p>“For the glamour.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m serious. You said yourself you don’t need this job. And you’re not very religious, are you?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“So why do you do it? That’s why Will and I do this, you know. Because it’s part of our faith. But with you, I don’t-” At that moment, the door opened and Mr. Green walked in. He was an older man in a hunting jacket and a cap whose</p>
<p>earflaps hung stiffly against his chin.</p>
<p>“How you doing, Mr. Green.”</p>
<p>“Fine, just fine. Getting chilly, though….”</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner and Mr. Albert quickly followed, then the rest of the group, all bundled up against the hint of an early</p>
<p>winter. They unbuttoned their coats, prepared coffee for themselves, and engaged in the small, unhurried talk that helped warm up the room. Finally Will walked in wearing cut-off jeans and a red T-shirt with “Deacon Will” across the front, and after asking Mrs. Jeffrey to lead us in prayer, he started the meeting. While everyone talked, I took notes to myself, speaking up only when things started to wander. In fact, I thought the meeting had already dragged on too long- a few people had slipped out after an hour-when Will added a new item to the agenda.</p>
