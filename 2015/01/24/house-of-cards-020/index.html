          <p>Five minutes later he was back in his own room and on the phone to Urquhart.</p>
<p>‘Delivery made and dinner fixed.’</p>
<p>‘Splendid, Roger. You’ve been most helpful. I hope the Foreign Secretary will be grateful too.’</p>
<p>‘But I still don’t see how you are going to get him to invite Penny to dinner. What’s the point of all this?’</p>
<p>The point, dear Roger, is that he will not have to invite her to dinner at all. He is coming to my reception this evening. You will bring Penny, who you have established is more than willing to meet and spend some time with him. I shall introduce them over a glass of champagne or two, and see what develops. If I know Patrick Woolton - which as Chief Whip I do - it won’t take more than twenty minutes before he’s suggesting that they go to his room to discuss -how does Private Eye put it - Ugandan affairs?’</p>
<p>‘Or French lessons,’ muttered O’Neill. ‘But I still don’t see where that gets us.’</p>
<p>‘Whatever happens, Roger, you and I will know about it. And knowledge is always useful.’ ‘I still don’t see how.’</p>
<p>Trust me, Roger. You must trust me.’</p>
<p>‘I do. I have to: I don’t really get much choice, do I?’</p>
<p>That’s right, Roger. Now you are beginning to see. Knowledge is power’</p>
<p>The phone went dead. O’Neill thought he understood but wasn’t absolutely sure. He still often struggled to figure out whether he was Urquhart’s partner or prisoner, but could never really decide. He rummaged in his bedside cabinet and took out a small carton. He swallowed a couple of sleeping pills and collapsed fully clothed on the bed.</p>
<p>‘Patrick. Thanks for the time’</p>
<p>‘You sounded quite serious on the phone. When Chief Whips say they want an urgent private word with you, they usually mean they’ve got the</p>
<p>photographs under lock and key but unfortunately the News of the World has got the negatives!’</p>
<p>Urquhart smiled and slipped through the open door into the Foreign Secretary’s room. He had not come far, indeed only a few yards from his own</p>
<p>bungalow next door in what the local constabulary had named ‘Overtime Alley’ the row of luxury private bungalows in the grounds of the conference hotel which housed leading Ministers, all of whom had a 24-hour rota of police guards running up huge overtime bills for the hapless local ratepayers.</p>
<p>‘Drink?’ the genial Lancastrian offered.</p>
<p>Thanks, Patrick. Scotch.’</p>
<p>The Right Honourable Patrick Woolton, Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and one of Merseyside’s many successful emigres, busied himself at a small drinks cabinet which quite obviously had already been used that afternoon, while Urquhart placed the Ministerial red box he was carrying in the corner of the room beside the four belonging to his overworked host. The brightly coloured leather-clad boxes are provided to all Ministers to house their official papers, speeches and other items which they require to keep secure. Red boxes go wherever Ministers go, even on holiday, and the Foreign Secretary was habitually followed around by a host of the small suitcase-sized containers carrying telexes and despatches, briefing papers and the other paraphernalia of diplomacy. The Chief Whip, with no conference speech to make and no foreign crises to handle, had arrived in Bournemouth with his box filled with three bottles of twelve-year-old malt whisky. Hotel drink prices are always staggering, he explained to his wife, even when you can find the brand you want.</p>
<p>He faced Woolton across a paper-strewn coffee table, and dispensed with the small talk.</p>
<p>‘Patrick, I need to take your mind. In the strictest confidence. As far as I am concerned, this has to be one of those meetings which never took place.’</p>
<p>‘Christ, you do have some photographs!’ exclaimed Woolton, now only half joking. His eye for attractive young women was much discussed, but he was usually highly discreet, especially when he travelled abroad. Ten years earlier when he was just starting his Ministerial career, he had spent several painful hours answering questions from the Louisiana State Police about a weekend he had spent in a New Orleans motel with a young American girl who looked twenty, acted as if she were thirty and turned out to be just a few days over sixteen. The incident had been brushed over, but Woolton had never forgotten the tiny difference between a glittering political future and a charge of statutory rape.</p>
<p>￼’Something which could be rather more serious. I’ve been picking up some unhealthy vibrations in the last few weeks about Henry. You’ve sensed some of the irritation with him around the Cabinet table, and the media seem to be falling out of love with him in a very big way. There was no reason to expect an extended honeymoon after the election, but it’s in danger of getting out of hand. I have just been approached by two of the most influential grass-roots party members saying that feeling at local level is getting very bad. We lost two more important local council by-elections last week in what should have been very safe seats, and we are going to lose quite a few more in the weeks ahead. Our majority in the Dorset by- election tomorrow is likely to be hit badly. To put no finer point on it, Patrick, the PM’s unpopularity is dragging the whole Party down and we would have trouble winning an election for local dogcatcher at the moment. We seem to have blown it rather badly’ Urquhart paused for a sip of whisky.</p>
<p>The problem is,’ he continued, ‘there’s a view around that this is not just a passing phase. If we are to win yet another election, we will have to show plenty of vigour and life otherwise the electorate will want a change simply out of boredom. Quite a few of our backbenchers in marginal seats are already beginning to get nervous, and with a majority of just 24 we may not have as much time as we would like. A few lost by-elections and we</p>
<p>could be forced into an early election.7</p>
<p>He took another sip of whisky, cupping his hands around the tumbler as if to draw reassurance for his difficult task from the warm, peaty liquid.</p>
<p>I’ll come to the point, Patrick. I’ve been asked as Chief Whip…’ - notice the formality, nothing personal in this, old chap - ‘… by one or two of our senior colleagues to take some gentle soundings about how deep the problem actually goes. In short, Patrick, and you will appreciate this is not easy…’ - it never is, but it never seems to stop or even slow the inevitable thrust - ‘… I’ve been asked to find out how much trouble you personally</p>
<p>think we are in. Is Henry any longer the right leader for us?’ He took a deep draught and settled back in his chair.</p>
<p>The silence settled around the Foreign Secretary, impaling him on the point of the question. It took him more than a minute to respond. A pipe appeared out of his pocket, followed by a tobacco pouch and a box of Swan Vestas. He patiently filled the bowl, tamping down the fresh tobacco with his thumb, and took out a match. The striking of the match seemed very loud in the silence, and Urquhart shifted uneasily in his chair. Smoke began to rise from around Woolton as he drew on the pipe stem, until the sweet smelling tobacco was well alight and his face was almost hidden from view by a clinging blue fog. He waved his hand to disperse it and through the clearing air he looked directly at Urquhart, and chuckled. -</p>
<p>‘You’ll have to forgive me, Francis. Four years in the Foreign Office has not prepared me particularly well for handling direct questions like that. Maybe I’m not used any more to people coming straight to the point. I hope you will forgive me if I struggle a little to match your bluntness.’</p>
<p>This was nonsense, of course. Woolton was renowned for his direct, often combative political style which had found an uneasy home in the Foreign Office. He was simply playing for time, collecting his thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Let’s try to put aside any subjective views…’ - he blew another enormous cloud of smoke to hide the patent insincerity of the remark-‘… and analyse the problem like a civil service position paper.’</p>
<p>Urquhart continued to look strained and nervous, but smiled inwardly. He knew Woolton’s personal views, and so he already knew the conclusion at which their hypothetical civil servant was going to arrive.</p>
<p>‘First, have we really got a problem? Yes, and it’s a serious one. My lads, back in Lancashire are hopping mad, we have a couple of local by- elections coming up which we are going to lose, and the polls are looking awful. I think it’s right that you should be taking soundings.</p>
<p>‘Second, is there a painless solution to the problem? Don’t let us forget that Henry has led us successfully through our fourth election victory. He is the leader of the party which the voters supported. So it’s not easy so soon after an election to contemplate a radical alteration to either the policies or the personalities with which we were elected.’</p>
<p>Woolton was by now obviously beginning to relish the analysis.</p>
<p>‘Think it through. If there were any move to replace him - which is essentially what we are discussing…’ — Urquhart contrived to look pained at Woolton’s bluntness and once more examined the drink in his glass — ‘… it would be highly unsettling for the Party, while the Opposition would be rampant. It would, look like a messy palace coup and an act of desperation. What do they say? “Greater love hath no politician than he lay down the life of his friends to save his own”! We could never make it look like the response of a mature and confident political party, no matter how we tried to dress it up. It would take a new leader at least a year to repair the damage and glue together the cracks. So we should not fool ourselves that replacing Henry represents an easy option.</p>
<p>‘Third, when all is said and done, can Henry find the solution to the problem himself? Well, you know my views on that I stood against him for the leadership when Margaret retired, and I have not changed my mind that his selection was a mistake.’</p>
<p>Urquhart now knew that he had read his man well. While Woolton had never expressed any open dissatisfaction after the waves of the leadership election had settled, public loyalty is rarely more than a necessary cover for private ambition, and the Foreign Secretary had never done more than was strictly necessary to maintain that cover.</p>
<p>Woolton was now refilling their glasses while continuing his analysis. ‘Margaret managed an extraordinary balance of personal toughness and sense of direction. She was ruthless when she had to be - and often when she didn’t have to be as well. She always seemed to be in such a hurry to get where she was going that she had no time to take prisoners and .didn’t mind trampling on a few friends either. It didn’t matter so much because she led from in front. Yet Henry doesn’t have any sense of direction, only a love of office. And without that sense of direction, when he tries to be tough it simply comes across as arrogance and harshness. He tries to mimic Margaret but he hasn’t got the balls.</p>
<p>‘So these we have it. If we try to get rid of him we’re in deep trouble. If we keep him, to use an old Lancashire expression, we’re stuffed.’ He returned to his pipe, puffing furiously to rekindle its embers until he disappeared once more behind the haze.</p>
<p>￼Urquhart hadn’t spoken for nearly ten minutes, but now moved to the edge of his chair once again. ‘Yes, I see. But I don’t see. What is it you are saying, Patrick?’</p>
