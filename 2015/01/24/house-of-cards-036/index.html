          <p>On Saturday, he planned a rally amongst the party faithful in his constituency to wave the flag. A brightly decked hall packed with supporters whom he could greet on first-name terms - in front of the cameras, of course - seemed an ideal location for a major pronouncement on schools ‘ policy. He and his officials had been working on it for some time, and with just a little hurrying forward they would have it ready for announcement on Saturday - a Government-sponsored plan offering school leavers who could not find a job not only a guaranteed place on a training course, but now the opportunity to complete that training in another Common Market country, providing practical skills and language training as well.</p>
<p>Earle was confident it would be well received. The speech would glow with rapture about the new horizons and job opportunities which would open up for young people, and the mortal blow he was delivering to the British businessman’s traditionally apathetic approach to dealing with foreign customers in their own language.</p>
<p>And then the coup de grace. He had got the Common Market bureaucrats in Brussels to agree to pay for the whole thing. He could already feel the tumultuous applause washing over him, carrying him on to Downing Street.</p>
<p>There was a large crowd of cheering supporters outside the Essex village hall to greet him when he arrived at midday. They were waving little Union Jacks and old election posters which had been brought out to give the occasion all the atmosphere of the campaign trail. The village band struck up as he came through the doors at the rear of the hall, proceeding down the aisle shaking hands on all sides. The local mayor led him up onto the low wooden platform as the cameramen and lighting crews scurried around to find the best angle. He gazed out over the crowd, studding his eyes from the lights, waving to their applause even as the mayor tried to introduce him. He felt as if he was on the brink of the greatest personal triumph of his life.</p>
<p>Then he saw him. Standing in the front row, squashed between the other cheering supporters, waving and applauding with the rest of them. Simon. The one person in the world he had hoped he would never see or hear from again. He remembered how they had first met - how could he ever forget? It was in the railway carriage as Earle had been corning back from the late night rally in the North West. They had been alone, Earle had been drunk, and Simon had been very, very friendly. And handsome. As the train thundered through the night they had entered a different, dark world cut off from the bright lights and responsibilities they had just left, and Earle had discovered himself committing an act which would have made him liable to a prison sentence several years before, and which was still only legal between consenting adults in private. And a British Rail carriage twenty minutes out of Birmingham is not the most private of locations.</p>
<p>Earle had staggered out of the carriage at Euston, thrust two £20 notes into Simon’s hand, and spent the night at his club. He couldn’t face going back to the home he shared with his ailing mother.</p>
<p>He hadn’t seen Simon for another six months, but suddenly he had turned up in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament asking the police attendants if he could see him. When the Minister arrived the youth didn’t make a fuss, explaining how he had recognised Earle from the recent party political broadcast, asking for the money in a very delicate and gentle fashion. Earle had paid him some ‘expenses’ for his trip to London, but on Simon’s second visit a few weeks later he knew there would be no respite. He had instructed Simon to wait, and had sought sanctuary in the corner of the Chamber. He spent ten minutes looking over the scene which he had grown to love so dearly, knowing that the youth outside threatened everything he had.</p>
<p>He could find no answer himself, so he had gone straight along to the Chief Whip’s Office and spilled the lot. There was a youth sitting in the Central Lobby blackmailing him for a brief and stupid fling they had had many months before, he had confessed. He was finished.</p>
<p>Never mind, don’t worry, he had been assured. Worse things had happened on the retreat from Dunkirk. Point him out and leave it all to the Chief Whip.</p>
<p>Urquhart had been as good as his word. He had introduced himself to the boy, and assured him that if he were not off the premises in five minutes the police would be called and he would be arrested for blackmail. The boy was further assured that in such cases the arrest and subsequent trial were held with little publicity, no one would discover the name of the Member concerned, and few people would even hear how long he had been sent down for. Little more pressure was needed to persuade the youth he had made a terrible mistake and should depart as quickly as possible, but Urquhart had taken the precaution of taking down the details from Simon’s driving licence, just in case he were to continue to cause trouble and needed to be tracked down.</p>
<p>￼And now he was back there, in the front row, ready to make unknown demands about which Earle’s fevered imagination could only torment itself. The torment went on throughout the speech, which ended as a considerable disappointment to his followers. The content was there, printed in large type on his small pages of recycled paper, but the fire was gone. The faithful had come to listen to him, not his officials’ tired prose, yet he seemed to be elsewhere even as he was delivering the lines.</p>
<p>They still clapped and applauded enthusiastically when he was finished, but it didn’t help. The mayor had almost to drag him into the pit of the hall to satisfy the clamour of the crowd for one last handshake and the chance personally to wish their favourite son well. As they shouted at him and kissed his cheeks and pummelled him on the back, he was drawn ever closer to the youthful eyes staring benevolently at him, as if he were being dragged towards the gates of Hell itself.</p>
<p>But Simon caused no scene, did nothing but shake his hand warmly and smile prettily, one hand toying nervously with the gold medallion which swung ostentatiously around his neck. Then he was gone, just another face left behind in the crowd, and Earle was in his car speeding back towards London and safety. -</p>
<p>When he arrived back at home, two men were standing outside in the cold street waiting for him.</p>
<p>‘Evening, Mr Earle. Simmonds and Peters from the Minor. Interesting rally you had. We’ve got the press handout, the words, but we need a bit of colour for our readers. like how the audience reacted. Got anything to say about your audience, Mr Earle?’</p>
<p>He rushed inside without saying anything, slamming the door behind him. He watched through a curtained window as they shrugged their shoulders and retreated to the estate car parked on the other side of the street. They pulled out a book and a thermos flask, and settled in for the long night ahead.</p>
<p>￼SUNDAY 21st NOVEMBER</p>
<p>They were still there the following morning just after dawn when Earle looked out. One was asleep, napping under a trilby hat pulled down over his eyes. The other was reading the Sunday newspapers, which bore little resemblance to the previous week’s editions. A leadership campaign which then had been dead in the water had now, with Urquhart’s intervention and McKenzie’s catastrophe, sprung to life. And the pollsters were beginning to wear down the MPs’ resistance to their probing.</p>
<p>‘All square!’ declared the Observer, announcing that the 60 per cent of the Parliamentary Party they had managed to cajole into giving a view were now evenly split between the three leading candidates - Samuel, Earle and Woolton, with Urquhart close behind and McKenzie now clearly out of it. The small lead to which Samuel had previously clung had entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>But the news gave no joy to Earle. He had spent a ruinous and totally sleepless night, pacing the floors but being able to find no solace. Everywhere he had looked for comfort, he could see only Simon’s face. The presence of the two journalists had kept nagging at him. How much did they know? Why were they squatting on his doorstep? The long wait through the night until the first fingers of dawn spread cold and grey in the November sky had drained him of hope and resistance. He had to know for certain.</p>
<p>Peters nudged Simmonds awake as the unshaven figure of Earle, his silk dressing gown dragged tightly around him, appeared at the front door of the house and made towards them.</p>
<p>‘Works like a dream every time,’ Peters said. ‘They simply can’t resist trying to investigate, like a mouse after cheese. Let’s see what he has to say for himself, Alf - and turn that bloody tape machine on’</p>
<p>‘Good morning, Mr Earle,’ Peters, shouted as Earle approached. ‘Don’t stand out there in the cold, sit inside. Care for a cup of coffee?’ ‘What do you want? Why are you spying on me?’</p>
<p>‘Spying, Mr Earle? Don’t be silly, we’re just looking for a bit of colour. You’re a leading candidate in an important election campaign. Seen the newspapers yet? People are bound to take more interest in you - about your hobbies, what you do, who your friends are.’</p>
<p>‘I have nothing to say!’</p>
<p>‘Could we interview your wife, perhaps?’ asked Simmonds. ‘Silly me, you’re not married, of course, are you Mr Earle?’</p>
<p>‘What are you implying?’ Earle demanded in a contorted, high pitched voice.</p>
<p>‘My goodness me nothing at all, sir. By the way, have you seen the photos of your rally yesterday? They’re very good, really clear. We’re thinking of using one on our front page tomorrow. Here, have a look.’</p>
<p>A hand thrust a large glossy photograph out of the window and waved it under Earle’s nose. He grabbed it, and gasped. It clearly showed him gripping the hand and looking straight into the eyes of a smiling Simon. The details were awesomely clear, perhaps too clear. It almost looked as if some hidden hand had added a trace of eyeliner around Simon’s large eyes, and his fleshy, petulant lips appeared to have been made darker, more prominent. As his manicured fingers played with the gold medallion around his neck, he looked very, very effeminate.</p>
<p>‘Know him well, do you, sir?’</p>
<p>Earle threw the photograph back through the car window.</p>
<p>‘What are you trying to do? I deny everything. I shall report your harassment to your editor!’</p>
<p>Earle rushed back towards his front door.</p>
<p>‘Editor, sir? Why, bless me, it was him what sent us’ Simmonds shouted at the Minister’s retreating back.</p>
<p>As the door slammed shut behind the fleeing figure, Peters turned to his colleague. There goes one very worried man, Alf.’ They settled back to their newspapers.</p>
<p>￼MONDAY 22nd NOVEMBER</p>
<p>Kendrick had accepted Mattie’s request for a chat with alacrity. He wasn’t sure he had been so keen simply because as an Opposition backbencher he was flattered to be in demand, or simply because his eyes flared and his knees tingled every time he saw her. In any event, it didn’t really matter to Kendrick what his real motives were, he was delighted to meet with her. He was making their tea himself in his single room office in Norman Shaw North, the red brick building made famous in countless ageing black and white films as New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police. The forces of law and order had long since moved to a more modem and efficient base in Victoria Street, but the parliamentary authorities had been delighted to snap up the vacant, albeit dilapidated, space just across the road from the Houses of Parliament to provide much needed additional working room for the horrendously overcrowded Members of Parliament.</p>
