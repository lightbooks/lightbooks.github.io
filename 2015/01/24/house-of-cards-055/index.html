          <p>‘No, not really. At least not until recently. As far as I know they had scarcely spoken to each other before the election, but they have talked with each other a couple of times on the phone since then, and they met for dinner. I don’t think even now they are -were - very close, though. Last time they spoke Roger was upset. Something about a computer file which got Roger very angry.’</p>
<p>At last the pieces began to fit.</p>
<p>‘One more question, Penny. I presume Francis Urquhart has a country residence as well as his house in Pimlico. Do you happen to know where that is?’</p>
<p>‘No, I don’t I’m afraid. I’ve only got a list of Cabinet weekend telephone numbers which I keep for Roger.’ ‘Can I have the Urquhart number?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t, Mattie, they are absolutely confidential. You must remember there have been terrorist attacks at Ministers’ homes, and it would be totally wrong for me to give them out to the press, even to you. I am sorry, Mattie, truly.’</p>
<p>‘Can you tell me the area in which he fives? Not the address, just the town or even the county?’ ‘I don’t know it. I’ve only got the telephone number.’ ‘Give me the dialling code, then. Just the dialling code’ she pleaded.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a slight shuffling of paper at the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>‘Mattie, I’m not sure why you want it, but it is to help Roger, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>T promise you, Penny.’</p>
<p>‘042128.’</p>
<p>Thanks. You won’t regret it.’</p>
<p>Mattie flicked the receiver and got a new line. She punched the area code into the telephone, followed by a random set of numbers. A connection was made, and a phone started ringing at the other end.</p>
<p>‘Lyndhurst 37428’ a drowsy voice announced.</p>
<p>‘Good evening. I’m sorry to bother you so late. Is that Lyndhurst, Surrey, 37428?’</p>
<p>‘No. It’s Lyndhurst in Hampshire 37428. And it’s very late for you to be telephoning wrong numbers!’ an irritated voice snapped before the phone was disconnected.</p>
<p>The fire inside Mattie was roaring brightly now as she threw herself across the room towards her bookcase, where she ripped a road atlas from its place. She scrabbled through the maps until she found the South Coast section, jabbed a finger at the page and whooped with triumph.</p>
<p>It’s him, Johnnie. It’s him!’</p>
<p>He looked over her shoulder at where the finger was placed It was pointing directly at the Rownhams service area on the M27 where O’Neill had died It was the first service station on the motorway back to London from Lyndhurst. O’Neill had died less than eight miles from Urquhart’s country home.</p>
<p>￼TUESDAY 30th NOVEMBER</p>
<p>The morning newspapers fell onto the doormats of a million homes like a death knell for Samuel’s candidacy. One by one, editor by editor, they began to line up behind Urquhart. It was not surprising to the Chief Whip that all the newspapers in the Telegraph and United Newspapers groups came to the same conclusion - some with more enthusiasm than others, to be sure, but to the same conclusion nonetheless - but it was of even greater satisfaction that many of the others had also decided to throw their weight behind him. Editorial offices tend to provide little comfort for politicians who trail their consciences; and some still remembered how badly their papers had got their fingers burnt with Neville Chamberlain’s pious bits of paper. Others had reached the same cynical conclusion as Woolton about the drawbacks of creating another ‘era’ so soon after Thatcher which, with Samuel’s youth, could last another fifteen years or more. Phrases such as ‘experience’, ‘maturity’ and ‘balance’ were peppered freely around the columns. Still others wanted simply to play safe, wishing to swim with the tide which was flooding strongly in Urquhart’s favour.</p>
<p>Only two newspapers stood out amongst the quality ‘ press, theGuardian for its habit of deliberately swimming against the tide, requiring it to support Samuel, and the Independent which stood proud and isolated like a rock withstanding the battering of storms and tide, refusing to endorse either.</p>
<p>The mood was reflected in the two camps, with Urquhart’s supporters finding it difficult to hide their air of quiet confidence, and Samuel’s finding it impossible in private to disguise their sense of looming disappointment.</p>
<p>As the tall doors of Committee Room 14 swung open at 10 a.m. to accept the first batch of MPs waiting outside to vote, neither Sir Humphrey nor others present expected any disappointments.</p>
<p>In best traditional style it would be an orderly and gentlemanly ballot; the loser would be gracious and the winner even more so. The covering of snow which was beginning steadily to blanket Westminster gave the proceedings a surrealistic calm. It would be Christmas soon, it reminded them, and the lights had already long been switched on in Oxford Street Time soon for the winter break, for family reunions and peace on earth. The long period of indecision would be over in a few hours and ordinary folk could return to their normal lives. In public there would be handshakes and congratulations all the way round when the result was announced, even as in private the victors planned their recriminations and the losers plotted their revenge.</p>
<p>When Mattie walked towards the office of Benjamin Landless just off Charterhouse Square, the snow was several inches thick. Outside the capital the snow had settled much more deeply, making travel difficult and persuading many commuters simply to stay at home. The streets of the City of London were strangely quiet in their white cocoon as the falling flakes muffled all sound and the few cars crept quietly about their business. She felt unreal, as if she were on a film set acting out a role, hoping she would wake up in the morning and discover that the script had been changed. Even now she was tempted to turn around and forget all about it, to let others concern themselves about the great affairs of state while she concentrated on paying her mortgage and whether she could afford a holiday next year.</p>
<p>Then a flurry of snow blew into her face, blinding her and transporting her back many years before she was born to an isolated Norwegian fjord and her grandfather setting off in a leaking fishing boat to risk his life on the tides of war. He could have collaborated, turned a blind eye, left it to others to sort out the world while he got on with his own life. But something had driven him on, just as she was being driven now.</p>
<p>When at first she had realised the necessity of confronting Landless, she had discovered all the many reasons why it would be futile - she wouldn’t even get to see him; if she did he would ruthlessly ensure that she would never work as a journalist again, and she wouldn’t be the first such victim. She had seen him bully and intimidate so many, how could she expect to succeed where so many other more experienced and powerful hands had failed? She had to confront him yet she desperately needed his help. And how was she supposed to squeeze support from a man who instinctively would prefer to throttle her with his own huge hands?</p>
<p>It was only when she realised that she had run out of time and alternatives that she summoned up the courage to unravel her excuses and deal with them one by one. Her first problem was access to the heavily protected businessman. He may depict himself as a man of the people, but he took elaborate and expensive precautions to ensure that he did not have to rub shoulders with them.</p>
<p>So she had phoned the writer of the Telegraph’s diary column, the keeper of society’s gossip and scandal. Had Landless recently had any close female friends, women of whom he was known to be particularly fond? Fine! A lady twenty years younger than him, now safely ensconced in Wiltshire with a new husband and brood, but known to have been the favoured recipient of a large measure of the magnate’s hugely expensive overtime. Mrs Susannah Richards. Yes, she hoped that would do nicely.</p>
<p>But nothing seemed easy as she walked along the strange, empty streets. She arrived at her destination and shook the snow from her boots and hair. She was surprised to see how small were the offices from which Landless ran his many empires, and how opulently the East-Ender had learned to live. The place reeked of British tradition. The small foyer and reception area was cloaked almost entirely in English carved oak panelling, on which were hung several fine oil paintings of old London scenes and a vast portrait of the Queen. The carpeting was thick, the electronics sophisticated and the commissionaire very ex-military.</p>
<p>‘Can I help you, Miss?’ he asked from beneath his pencil-line moustache.</p>
<p>‘My name is Mrs Susannah Richards. I am a personal friend of Mr Landless, you understand,’ she explained with a hint of intrigue, ‘and I was passing in the vicinity. He’s not expecting me, but could you see if he has five minutes free? I have an important personal message for him.’</p>
<p>The commissionaire was all discretion and efficiency-it was so rare that one of the boss’s ‘personal friends’ came to the office, and he was eager to make a good impression. He relayed the message to Landless’s secretary precisely and with just the right degree of enthusiasm. No doubt the secretary passed on the message in similar fashion, for within a few seconds Mattie was being ushered into the lift with instructions to proceed to</p>
<p>￼￼￼the top floor.</p>
<p>As she stood in the doorway of the penthouse suite, Landless was seated behind his desk in the middle of a vast office which had been designed to accommodate his own huge bulk. She had time to take in none of the detail before an animal growl of rage began erupting from his throat.</p>
<p>‘You miserable bloody cow…’</p>
<p>She had to cut him short. Before he had time to make up his mind, let alone utter the angry words of dismissal, she had to take control. It was her only slender chance.</p>
<p>‘It’s your takeover of United.’</p>
<p>‘The takeover? What about it?’ he shouted, betraying only the slightest edge of interest. It’s finished.’ ‘What on earth do you mean?’ he snarled, but a little less loudly this time.</p>
<p>She stood there, silent, challenging him to decide whether his curiosity would overcome his anger. It took a moment before she knew she had won the first round. With a snort, he waved a fleshy hand in the direction of a chair. It was a good six inches lower than his own, down onto which he could glower from beneath his huge, eruptive eyebrows and stare its occupant into submission. She moved slowly into the room, but away from the chair. She wasn’t going to give him the advantage of physically intimidating her on the low, uncomfortable perch. Anyway, she felt better moving around.</p>
<p>‘You’ve backed the wrong horse. Francis Urquhart has cheated and lied his way to the party leadership, and possibly much worse. By the time that all gets out, his endorsement of the takeover won’t be worth a bean.’</p>
<p>‘But he hasn’t endorsed the takeover. He said he wouldn’t decide until after the leadership election.’</p>
<p>‘But you and I know that is only part of the deal you did with him - the support of your newspapers in return for his approval of the takeover after he had won.’</p>
<p>‘What the hell are you talking about? You listen to me, you little bitch…’</p>
<p>‘No, Mr Landless. It’s you who’s going to have to listen to me!’ She was smiling now, trying to display the quiet confidence of a poker player intent on persuading her opponent that the cards she held were of much higher value than his own. She had no proof, of course, only the coincidence</p>
