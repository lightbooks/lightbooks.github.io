          <p>He spoke a little more quietly. ‘If you can’t get the figures, make the bloody things up. They will all be too exhausted to look at them closely, and if we get in there first and loudest we’ll be fine.’</p>
<p>He paused only to blow his nose, which did nothing to ease the other man’s visible discomfort.</p>
<p>‘And remember that I want you to send the most enormous bunch of flowers around to the PM’s wife first thing in the morning. In the shape of a gigantic letter ‘C. She must get them as soon as she wakes up. She’ll get into a twist if they don’t arrive because I’ve already told her they are corning. And I want the TV cameras to film them going in and to know who’s sent them, so make sure they are bigger and more eye-catching than anything they’ve ever seen before. Even better, send them round in the back of oneof your company vans. That should look good pulled up outside</p>
<p>￼Number Ten’</p>
<p>The advertising executive was used to his client’s breathless monologues by now, and even to some of the extraordinary instructions and accounting procedures issued by O’Neill. But a political party was unlike any other client he had ever encountered, and the last two years working on the account had given him and his youthful agency more than enough publicity to stifle most of the lingering doubts.</p>
<p>Now the election was over, however, and he was waiting nervously for the results, a silent fear struck him as he thought of what would happen if they lost; to have supported the losing side, probably to be made the scapegoat for failure. It had all looked rather different when they had started the work, with the opinion polls predicting a comfortable win. But his confidence had begun to evaporate with the exit polls. In an industry of images, he realised that his business could wither as rapidly as the flowers which O’Neill was making such a fuss about</p>
<p>He sucked his tip nervously as O’Neill rattled on, until their attention was grabbed by the six-foot image of Sir Alastair, who was now holding his ear with his head cocked to one side. Something was corning through his earpiece.</p>
<p>‘And now I believe we are ready for the first result of the evening, which looks likely to be in Torbay once again. Breaking all records. It is just forty- three minutes after the polls have closed, and already the candidates are gathering behind the returning officer and it’s time to go over live…’</p>
<p>In Torbay Town Hall, amidst the banks of hyacinths and spider plants, rosettes and mayoral regalia, the first result was being announced. The scene resembled more a village pantomime than an election, as the promise of nationwide television coverage had attracted more than the usual number of crank candidates who were now doing their best to capture the moment by waving balloons and brightly coloured hats to attract the cameras’ attention.</p>
<p>The Sunshine Candidate, dressed from head to toe in a bright yellow leotard and waving the most enormous plastic sunflower, stood firmly in front of the sober suited Tory, who tried to move to his left to escape from the embarrassment but only succeeded in bumping into the National Front candidate, who was inciting a minor riot in the crowd by displaying a clenched fist and an armful of tattoos. Not quite sure what his candidates manual would prescribe in such circumstances, he reluctantly retreated back behind the sunflower.</p>
<p>Sir Alastair came to his rescue. ‘So there we have it from colourful Torbay. The Government hold the first seat of the night but with a reduced majority and a swing against them of, the computer says, nearly 8 per cent. What does that mean, Peter?’ asked Burnet, as the screen cut to ITN’s tame academic commentator, a bespectacled and rather ragged figure in Oxford tweeds.</p>
<p>It means the exit poll is just about right, Alastair.’</p>
<p>‘Great show, Roger, isn’t it? After all, it looks like another majority. I can’t tell you how absolutely relieved and delighted I am. Well done indeed,’ enthused the chairman of one of Grunt &amp; Groans major clients, thoroughly enjoying what was tinning into a fully-fledged victory party irrespective of the fact that the Government had just lost its first two seats of the night. He was standing crushed together along with two other invited clients and the agency’s chairman in a corner which gave some slight relief from the pressure of celebration going on all around. ‘That’s very kind of you, Harold. Yes, I think a 30 or 40-seat majority will be enough. But you must take some of the credit.’ O’Neill was gushing. ‘I was reminding the Prime Minister just the other day how your support goes way beyond the Corporate donation. I remember the speech you gave at the Industrial Society lunch last March. You know, it was extremely good, you really got the message home well. Surely you’ve had professional training?’</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, O’Neill rushed on. ‘you’ve pushed home the message about gaining cooperation from all sides by showing leadership from the top and I told Henry- I’m sorry, the PM - that we need to find more platforms for captains of industry like you to express these views.’</p>
<p>There was no need for that,’ replied the captain without the slightest trace of sincerity. The champagne had already overcome his natural caution and images of ermine and the House of Lords began to materialise in front of his eyes. ‘But that was very kind of you. Look, when this is all over perhaps we could have lunch together. Somewhere a little quieter, eh? I have several other ideas on which I would very much welcome your views.’ y O’Neill’s response was a series of enormous sneezes which bent him almost double, leaving his eyes tearful and rendering any hope of continued conversation impossible.</p>
<p>‘Sorry,’ he spluttered. ‘Hay fever. I always seem to get it early.’ As if to emphasise the point he blew his nose forcefully and wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>The TV screen promptly announced the loss of another Government seat, a Junior Minister with responsibility for Transport who had spent the last four years earnestly visiting every motorway crash scene in the country and who had quite convinced himself of the human race’s unquenchable capacity for violent self-sacrifice. It did not help him, however, to accept their demand for his own self-sacrifice, and he was finding it very difficult to put on a brave face.</p>
<p>‘More bad news for the Government,’ commented Burnet, ‘and we shall see how the Prime Minister is taking it when we go over live for his result in just a few minutes. In the meantime, what is the computer predicting now?’</p>
<p>He punched a button and turned to look at a large screen behind his shoulder. ‘Still around 30 by the look of it.’</p>
<p>A studio discussion then began as to whether a majority of 30 was enough to see a Government through a full term of office, but the discussion was interrupted by more results which now began to flood in. O’Neill excused himself from the group of businessmen and fought his way through a growing and steadily more voluble group of admirers which had gathered around Penny. In spite of their protests he drew her quickly to one side and whispered briefly in her ear, as the ruddy face of Sir Alastair intruded once more into the celebrations to announce that the Prime Minister’s own result was just about to be declared.</p>
<p>A respectful if not total silence grew over the revellers, and O’Neill returned to the industrial captains. All eyes were fixed on the screen. No one noticed Penny gathering her bag and slipping quietly out.</p>
<p>￼The screen announced another Government win, but yet again with a reduced majority. While the commentators analysed and sought to be the first to get in with their view that the Government were indeed having a less than splendid night of it, a loyal roar of approval arose from all the agency staff present, most of whom had by now totally forgotten their own political convictions and were ready to celebrate at the slightest excuse. After all, it was only an election.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister waved back from the screen, his stretched smile indicating that he was taking the result rather more seriously than was his audience. The festive mood began to drown out his speech of thanks to the returning officer and local police, and by the time he had left the platform to begin his long drive back to London two agency art directors were pronouncing the official demise of the battered fig trees.</p>
<p>A shout from across the room reached through to O’Neill’s group.</p>
<p>‘Mr O’Neill. Mr O’Neill. Telephone for you.’ The security guard held the telephone up in the air and pointed dramatically to the mouthpiece. ‘Who is it?’ mouthed O’Neill back across the room.</p>
<p>‘What?’ queried the guard, looking nervous.</p>
<p>‘Who is it?’ he mouthed again.</p>
<p>‘Can’t hear you,’ the guard yelled above the hubbub, gesticulating wildly.</p>
<p>O’Neill cupped his hands around his mouth and once more demanded to know who it was.</p>
<p>It’s the Prime Minister’s Office!’ screamed the frustrated guard, unable to restrain himself and not quite knowing whether he should be standing to attention..</p>
<p>His words had an immediate effect, and the noise of celebration subsided into an expectant hush. An avenue to the telephone suddenly opened up in front of O’Neill, and he slowly and obediently made his way over to the phone, trying to look modest and matter of fact.</p>
<p>It’s one of his secretaries. She will put you through,’ said the guard, obviously grateful to hand over the awesome responsibility.</p>
<p>‘Hello. Hello. Yes, this is Roger.’ A brief pause. ‘Prime Minister! How are you? Many, many congratulations. The result is really very good in the circumstances. A victory is sweet whether you win 5-0 or 5-4 … Yes, yes. Oh, that’s so kind. I’m at the advertising agency as it happens.’</p>
<p>The room was now so hushed they could almost hear the fig trees crying. 1 think they have performed marvellously, and I certainly couldn’t have done it without their support … May I tell them that?’</p>
<p>He put his hand over the mouthpiece and turned to the totally enraptured audience. The Prime Minister just wants me to thank you all on his behalf for helping run such a fantastic campaign. He says it made all the difference.’ He went back to the phone and listened for a few seconds more. ‘And he’s not going to demand the money back!’</p>
<p>With that the room erupted into a great roar of applause and cheers, and O’Neill held the phone aloft to catch every last sound.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Prime Minister. I am totally thrilled and honoured to receive your first telephone call after your own election .. .I look forward to seeing you, too. Yes, I shall be at Smith Square later… Of course, of course. I will see you then, and congratulations once again. Good night’</p>
<p>He replaced the telephone gently in its cradle, and turned to face the whole room: Suddenly his face burst into abroad smile, and as he did so the entire gathering broke out into a series of ringing cheers. They pummelled him forcefully on the back as he tried to shake all their hands at once. He was still trying to force his way back to the beaming captains as, in the next street, Penny carefully put down the car phone and began to adjust her lipstick in the car mirror.</p>
<p>￼FRIDAY 11th JUNE</p>
<p>The onlookers in Smith Square had increased dramatically in number as they waited for the Prime Minister’s arrival. Midnight had long since tolled but tonight biological clocks would be stretched to the limit. They could see from the TV technicians’ monitors that his convoy, escorted by police outriders and pursued by camera cars, had long since left the Ml and was now approaching Marble Arch. It would be less than ten minutes before they arrived, and three youthful cheerleaders were encouraging the crowd to warm up with a mixture of patriotic songs and shouts.</p>
