          <p>‘So everyone simply has to remain where they are. Do you think that’s a sound strategy?’</p>
<p>He took a deep mouthful of whisky. ‘If I were the captain of the Titanic and I saw a bloody great iceberg dead ahead, I don’t think I would be saying “steady as she goes”. I’d want a change of course.’</p>
<p>Did you tell this to the Prime Minister this afternoon?’</p>
<p>‘Mattie, you take me too far!’ he chuckled in protest. ‘While I respect your professional integrity and I am thoroughly enjoying our conversation, I think I would be offering you too much temptation if I started divulging the details of private discussions. That’s a shooting offence!’</p>
<p>Mattie had not moved from the edge of her chair. She understood very clearly the significance of his words, and was determined to gather more. ‘Well, let me ask you about Lord Williams. He was with the PM an extraordinarily long time this ‘afternoon if all they were deciding was to do nothing’</p>
<p>Urquhart had been toying with this specific stiletto for several minutes. Now he threw it with deadly accuracy. ‘Have you heard the phrase, “Beware of an old man in a hurry”?’</p>
<p>‘You surely can’t imagine that he believes he could become Party Leader. Not from the Lords!’</p>
<p>‘No, even he’s not that egotistical. But he still has a couple of years left, and like so many elder statesmen would like to make sure that the leadership found its way into suitable hands’</p>
<p>‘Whose hands?’</p>
<p>If not him, then one of his acolytes’ ‘Like who?’</p>
<p>‘Do you have no thoughts of your own?’ ‘You mean Michael Samuel’</p>
<p>Urquhart smiled as he heard the stiletto thud home. ‘I think I’ve said enough. We must call this conversation to a halt’</p>
<p>Mattie nodded reluctantly, and remained silent, pondering the pieces of the political jigsaw which now lay in front of her. Without further discussion Urquhart guided his guest downstairs, and they were shaking hands by the front door before she spoke again.</p>
<p>‘You’ve been very helpful, Mr Urquhart But one last question. If there were a leadership election, would you be part of it?’ ‘Good night, Mattie’ Urquhart said, and closed the front door firmly behind her.</p>
<p>Daily Telegraph. Monday 14th June. Page 1.</p>
<p>In a move which startled most observers, the Prime Minister yesterday announced that there were to be no immediate Cabinet changes following the election. After conferring for several hours with his Party</p>
<p>Chairman, Lord Williams, and also with the Chief Whip Francis Urquhart, Mr Collingridge issued a ‘steady as she goes’ message to his Party.</p>
<p>Downing Street sources said it was intended that the Government would be able to pursue their programme as quickly and as effectively as possible by leaving all Cabinet Ministers in place. However, senior Westminster sources last night expressed astonishment at the decision. It was</p>
<p>￼seen in some quarters as betraying the weakness of the Prime Minister’s position after the decimation of his parliamentary majority and criticisms of what was seen as a lacklustre campaign, for which both he and the Party Chairman are being blamed.</p>
<p>There was speculation last night that the Prime Minister was unlikely to fight another election, and that some senior Ministers were already manoeuvring for position in the event of an early leadership contest. One Cabinet Minister compared the Prime Minister to ‘the captain of the Titanic as it was entering the ice pack’.</p>
<p>The decision not to make any Cabinet changes, the first time since the war that an election has not been followed by some senior reshuffle, was interpreted as being the most effective way for Collingridge to keep the simmering rivalries of some of his Cabinet colleagues under control.</p>
<p>Last night, the Chief Whip defended the decision as being ‘the best means of getting on with the job’. However, speculation is already beginning as to who might be the likely contenders in the event of a leadership race.</p>
<p>Lord Williams described any suggestion of an imminent leadership election as ‘nonsense’. He said, ‘The Prime Minister has gained for the Party an historic fourth election victory, and we are in excellent shape.’ However, the position of the Party</p>
<p>Chairman would be crucial during a leadership race, and Williams is known to be very close to Michael Samuel, the Environment Secretary, who could be one of the contenders.</p>
<p>Opposition spokesmen were quick to pounce on what they saw as indecisiveness on the part of the Prime Minister. Claiming that he had been greatly heartened by the gains his Party had made last Thursday, the Opposition Leader said: The fires of discontent are glowing within the Government. I don’t think Mr Collingridge has the strength or the support to put them out. I am already looking forward to the next election…’</p>
<p>￼TUESDAY 22nd JUNE</p>
<p>Roger O’Neill sat back comfortably in the arms of one of the large leather armchairs which surround the snooker tables in the back room at White’s Club. When the tables are not in use, the seats which are spread around the games room offer a quiet and confidential spot for members to take their guests. He had been delighted, and not a little astonished, to receive the invitation from the Chief Whip to dine at his prestigious club in St James’s. Urquhart had never shown much warmth towards O’Neill in the past, and O’Neill had been more used to a cold and condescending gaze down Urquhart’s aquiline nose, rather like a well-fed bird eyeing future prey, than an invitation ‘to celebrate the splendid work which you have done for us all throughout the campaign’.</p>
<p>O’Neill, hypertense as always, had tried to calm his nerves with a couple of mighty vodka-tonics before he arrived, but they had not been necessary. Urquhart’s cosy manner, two bottles of Chateau Talbot ‘78 and the large cognacs which Urquhart was even now ordering from the bar suggested that O’Neill had at last been able to break through the barriers which some traditionalists within the party leadership still erected against the likes of O’Neill and his ‘marketing johnnies with their vulgar cars’. Even as O’Neill derided the traditionalists and their narrow jealousies, he desperately wanted their acceptance, and now he felt guilty for having misjudged Urquhart so badly. He beamed broadly as his host returned from the bar with two crystal glasses on a silver tray. O’Neill stubbed out his cigarette in preparation for the Havana which he hoped would be following.</p>
<p>‘Tell me, Roger, what are your plans now the election is over? Are you going to stay on with the Party? We can’t afford to lose good men like you.’ O’Neill flashed yet another winning smile and assured his host that he would stay on as long as the Prime Minister wanted him.</p>
<p>‘But how can you afford to, Roger? May I be brutally honest with you? I know just how little the Party pays its employees, and money is always so short after an election. It’s going to be tough for the next couple of years. Your salary will probably get frozen and your budget cut. Aren’t you tempted by some of the more handsome offers you must be getting from outside?’</p>
<p>‘Well, it’s not always easy, Francis, as you’ve already guessed. It’s not so much the salary, you understand. I work in politics because I’m fascinated by it and love to play a part. But it would be a tragedy if the budget gets cut.’</p>
<p>His smile faded as he contemplated the prospect and began to fidget nervously with his glass. ‘We should start working for the next election now, not in three years’ time when it may be too late. Particularly with all these rumours flooding around about splits within the Party and who is to blame for the loss of seats. We need some strong and positive publicity, and I need a budget to create it.’</p>
<p>‘The Chairman receptive to all this?’ Urquhart raised an enquiring eyebrow. ‘Are Chairmen ever?’</p>
<p>‘Perhaps, Roger, there is something I can do about that. I would like to be able to help you very much, because I think you’ve done such excellent work. Ill go in to bat with the Chairman about your budget, if you want. But there is something I must ask you first. And I must be blunt.’</p>
<p>The older man’s blue eyes looked directly into O’Neill’s, taking in their habitual flicker. He paused while O’Neill blew his nose loudly. Another habit, Urquhart knew. He examined O’Neill closely. It was as if there were another life going on within O’Neill which was quite separate from the rest of the world, and which communicated itself only through O’Neill’s hyperactive mannerisms and twitching eyes.</p>
<p>‘I had a visit the other day from an old colleague I used to know from the days when I held directorships in the City,’ Urquhart continued, lie’s one of the financial people at the Party’s advertising agency. And he was very troubled. Very discreet, but very troubled. He said you were in the habit of asking them for considerable sums of cash to cover your expenses.’</p>
<p>The twitching stopped for a moment, and Urquhart noticed just how rarely he had ever seen O’Neill stop moving.</p>
<p>‘Roger, let me assure you I am riot trying to trap you or trick you. This is strictly between us. But if I am to help you, I must be sure of the facts.’</p>
<p>The face and the eyes started up again, and O’Neill’s ready laugh made a nervous reappearance. ‘Francis, let me assure you that there’s nothing wrong at all. It’s silly, of course, but I am grateful that you raised it with me. It’s simply that there are times when I incur expenses on the publicity side which are easier and more convenient for the agency to meet rather than putting them through the Party machine. Like buying a drink for a journalist or taking a Party contributor out for a meal.’</p>
<p>O’Neill was speeding on with his explanation, which showed signs of having been practised. ‘You see, if I pay for them myself I have to claim back from the Party. We have a pretty laborious accounts department which takes its own sweet time paying those invoices - two months or more. Frankly, with the way I get paid, I can’t afford it. Yet if I charge them through the agency, I get the money back immediately while they have to put them through their own accounts before invoicing us at headquarters. That takes another month or so, which simply means that the Party gets an even longer holiday on repaying those expenses. It’s like an interest-free loan for the Party. And in the meantime I can get on with my job. The amounts are really very small’</p>
<p>O’Neill reached for his glass.</p>
<p>‘Like £22,300 in the last ten months small?’</p>
<p>O’Neill nearly choked. He put his glass down quickly and his face contorted as he struggled simultaneously to gulp down air and blurt out a denial. It’s nothing like that amount’ he protested. His jaw dropped as he debated what to say next. This explanation he hadn’t practised.</p>
<p>￼Urquhart turned away from him to signal for another two cognacs. His eyes returned calmly to O’Neill, whose twitching now resembled a fly caught in a spider’s web. Urquhart spun more silken threads.</p>
<p>‘Roger, you have been charging regular expenses to the agency without clearly accounting for those amounts to the tune of precisely £22,300 since the beginning of. September last year. What began as relatively small amounts have in recent months grown up to £4,000 a month. You don’t get through that many drinks and dinners even during an election campaign.’</p>
<p>‘I assure you, Francis, that any expenses I’ve charged have all been entirely legitimate!’ The choking had begun to subside. As the steward placed the fresh drinks on the table, Urquhart moved in to bind his prey with a lethal touch.</p>
