          <p>of timing to suggest a deal had been done, but now she understood about Urquhart it was the only scenario which made sense. Anyway, she had to keep raising the stakes, she had to force him to show his hand.</p>
<p>You see, you are not the first proprietor to put puppets into their newspapers as editors, but you made a great mistake when you chose Greville Preston. The man is so weak that every time you pulled the strings he started jerking around totally out of control. He couldn’t possibly pretend that he was his own boss. So when you, Mr Landless, decided to go gunning for Henry Collingridge at the party conference, there was no chance that Preston could pretend it was his own decision or hide the fact that he was acting under your direct instructions. And when you, Mr Landless, decided to propel Francis Urquhart into the leadership race at the last, dramatic minute through the editorial columns of the Telegraph, there was no chance that Preston could justify it to the staff. He had to slip it into the edition on a Sunday evening without any consultation, skulking around his own newspaper like a thief in the night. You see, he’s very good at doing what he’s told, but he simply doesn’t understand half the time why he’s been told to do it. If you like to put it that way, Mr Landless, in spite of all his university education you’re too good for him.’</p>
<p>Landless did not respond to the backhanded compliment. His fleshy features were set uncharacteristically rigid.</p>
<p>‘You made Urquhart’s candidacy. Put quite simply - as I am sure you have put it to him yourself - he could not be on the point of becoming Prime Minister without your help. And for that you would have got something in return - his agreement to turn the Government’s competition policy on its head and to endorse your takeover of United Newspapers.’</p>
<p>At last Landless came to life, calling her bluff.</p>
<p>‘What proof do you have of this extraordinary tale, Miss Storin?’</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of it. I don’t need proof. I need just enough to stir up the most awful public row and you will find the politicians deserting your camp and heading for the hills, no matter what they have been saying during the leadership contest. You will find yourself without a single friend.’</p>
<p>‘But according to your weird and wonderful hypothesis,</p>
<p>Francis Urquhart is my friend, and he will be in 10 Downing Street’ Landless smiled mockingly.</p>
<p>‘But not for long, Mr Landless, not for long. I’m afraid you know less about him than you think. Did you know, when you instructed Preston to use the opinion poll to undermine the Prime Minister, that it was Urquhart who had leaked it in the first place? He set you up.’</p>
<p>There was a sufficient look of surprise on Landless’s face to let Mattie know that she was right and he resented being used like that.</p>
<p>‘But all politicians leak’ Landless responded. It’s not criminal, certainly not enough to throw him out of Downing Street.’</p>
<p>‘No, but insider share dealing, fraud, blackmail and theft are!’ She delighted in the look of concern spreading across his fat jowls.</p>
<p>‘I can show beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Urquhart who set up Charles Collingridge by buying Renox shares in his name in a deliberate</p>
<p>￼and very successful attempt to implicate the Prime Minister. That Urquhart blackmailed Patrick Woolton into standing down by bugging his room at Bournemouth. And ordered, the theft of confidential personal files on Michael Samuel from party headquarters.’ She was bluffing on the Samuel file, she had no proof only inner certainty, but she knew her bluff would not be called from the way in which Landless had by now lost his air of confidence. Yet he was one of nature’s fighters. He hadn’t given in yet.</p>
<p>‘What makes you think anyone is going to believe you? By tonight Francis Urquhart will be Prime Minister, and who do you think is going to want to see the Prime Minister and the country dragged down by a political scandal of that sort? I think you underestimate the Establishment and its powers of self-protection, Miss Storin. If the Prime Minister is dragged down, confidence in the whole system suffers. It’s not justice which wins, but the radicals and the revolutionaries. Not even the Opposition would welcome that. So you’ll find it damned difficult to get any newspaper to print your allegations, and next to impossible to get a law officer to proceed on them.’</p>
<p>He was beginning to relish his own argument now, regaining his confidence.</p>
<p>‘Why, it took them seven years before they were forced to indict Jeremy Thorpe who was only Leader of the Liberal Party, not even the Prime Minister. And he was arrested for attempted murder, which makes your charges of petty theft and blackmail look really rather pathetic. You don’t even have a body on which to build your case!’</p>
<p>‘Oh, but I do, Mr Landless,’ she said softly. ‘I believe he killed Roger O’Neill to silence him, and although I’m not sure I can prove it yet, I can raise such a storm as will blow down the shutters of Downing Street and will quite overwhelm your little business venture. Someone in the Thorpe case shot a dog. Here we are talking about murder. Do you really think your Establishment is going to keep quiet about that?’</p>
<p>Landless levered his great girth out of his chair and walked across to the large picture window. From it he could see the chimneys, steeples and hideous tower blocks of Bethnal Green less than two miles away where he had been born and where in the slums of his childhood he had learnt all he needed to know about survival He had never wanted to move far away from the area even with all his wealth; his roots were there, and if he screwed it all up that was where he knew he would have to return.</p>
<p>When he turned around to face her once more, she thought she could detect the signs of defeat etched deep into his features. ‘What are you going to do, Miss Storin?’.</p>
<p>‘I am too late to stop Urquhart getting elected. But I intend to make sure he stays in office for as short a time as possible. And for that I want your help.’</p>
<p>‘My help! I… I don’t understand. You accuse me of causing all this bleedin’ chaos and then you ask for my help. Christ all bloody Mighty!’ he spluttered in broadest cockney, his defences in tatters.</p>
<p>‘Let me explain. You may be a rogue, Mr Landless, and you may run a rotten newspaper, but I suspect that deep down you care for the idea of a man like Urquhart running this country as little as I do. You have worked very hard to develop the reputation of a working class patriot. Corny to some people, perhaps, but I suspect you mean it - and if I’m right, you would never dream of conspiring to put a murderer in Downing Street.’</p>
<p>She paused but he said nothing.</p>
<p>In any event, I think I can persuade you to help on straightforward commercial grounds. Whatever happens, your takeover of United Newspapers is dead. You can either watch it be swept away in the storm which will undoubtedly engulf Urquhart, which means the Establishment will turn on you and you will never be able to raise money in the City of London for a business deal ever again - or you can kill it yourself, help me nail Urquhart, save your business and become the hero of the hour.’</p>
<p>‘Why should I trust you?’</p>
<p>‘Because I need you.’</p>
<p>‘Need me?’ his jowls fluttered in surprise.</p>
<p>‘I need you to be a good newspaper man and publish the full story. If it’s published with the backing of the Telegraph rather than dribbling out over the next few months in bits and pieces, nobody can ignore it. I will give you an exclusive which will blow your patriotic socks off. And once I’ve done that, I am scarcely going to be able to turn on you.’</p>
<p>‘AndifIsayno?’</p>
<p>Then I shall find an army of Opposition backbenchers who would like nothing more than to take all the ammunition I can provide them with, stand up in the House of Commons where they are protected from the laws of slander, and make accusations against both you and Urquhart which will bring you crashing down together.’</p>
<p>All her cards were on the table now. The game was nearly over. Had he any cards left up his sleeve?</p>
<p>‘Urquhart will fall, Mr Landless, one way or the other. The only thing you have to decide is whether you fall with him or help me push him…’</p>
<p>It was early afternoon before Mattie returned to Westminster. The snow had stopped falling and the skies were clearing, leaving the capital looking like a scene from a traditional Christmas card. The Houses of Parliament</p>
<p>looked particularly resplendent, like some wondrous Christmas cake covered in brilliant white icing beneath a crystal blue sky. Opposite in the churchyard of St Margaret’s, nestling under the wing of the great medieval</p>
<p>Abbey, carol singers brought an air of tranquillity and Victorian charm to the passers-by, wishing goodwill to all men.</p>
<p>￼Celebrations were already under way in various parts of the House of Commons. One of Mattie’s colleagues in the press gallery rushed over to explain.</p>
<p>‘About 80 per cent of Government MPs have already voted. They think Urquhart’s home and dry. It looks like a landslide.’</p>
<p>Big Ben tolled; to Mattie it had a new and awesome ring. She felt as if an icicle had dislodged itself from the Palace walls and pierced straight into her heart. But she had to press on.</p>
<p>Urquhart was not in his room, nor in any of the bars or restaurants in the Palace of Westminster. She asked in vain around the corridors after him and was just about to conclude that he had left the premises entirely, for lunch or interviews, when one of the Palace policemen told her that</p>
<p>he had seen Urquhart not ten minutes earlier headed in the direction of the roof garden. She had no idea that any roof garden existed, or even where it was.</p>
<p>‘Yes, miss. Not many people do know about our roof garden, and those that do like to keep quiet about it in case everybody rushes up there and spoils the charm. It’s directly above the House of Commons, all around the great central skylights which light up the Chamber itself. It’s a flat roof terrace, and we’ve put some tables and chairs up there so that in summer the staff can enjoy the sunshine, take some sandwiches and a flask of coffee. Not many Members know about it and even fewer ever go up there, but I’ve seen Mr Urquhart up there a couple of times before. Likes the view, I imagine. But it’ll be damned cold and lonely today, if you don’t mind my saying so.’</p>
<p>She followed his directions, up the stairs past the Strangers Gallery and up again until she had passed the panelled dressing room reserved for the Palace doorkeepers. Then she saw a fire door which was slightly ajar. As she stepped through it she emerged onto the roof, and drew in her breath sharply. The view was magnificent Right in front of her, towering into the cloudless sky, made brilliant in the sunshine and snow, was the tower of Big Ben, closer than she had ever seen it before. Every little detail of the beautifully crafted stone stood out with stunning clarity, and she could see the tremor of the great clock hands as the ancient but splendid mechanism pursued its remorseless course.</p>
<p>To the left she could see the great tiled roof of Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace, which had survived the assault of fire, war, bomb and revolution and which had witnessed so much human achievement and misery. To her right she could see the River Thames, ebbing and flowing in its own irresistible fashion even as the tides of history swept capriciously along its banks. And in front of her she could see fresh footsteps in the snow.</p>
